<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,
soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill
to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains
producers.
    Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter
wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility
of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support
payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.
    He also said his bill would protect program participants
from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose
above the loan rate.

<TITLE>SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson
Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks
today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in
holding to its prescribed production quotas.
    "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota
restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.
    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to
higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes
said he recommends Imperial Oil &lt;IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,
Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon &lt;XON> one to
83-1/8, and Chevron &lt;CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.
    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic
Richfield &lt;ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is
still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose
1-3/4 to 77.
    He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a
barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is
positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher
oil prices."
    He noted that belief that the government is interested in
raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil
stocks today.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN MINISTER CONFIRMS COPPER DIVERSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala
confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South
Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had
closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.
    He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an
interview the government was diverting all mineral exports
along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in
Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper
and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports,
but he said there had not been any problem with the new
arrangements.
    "So far our copper has been reaching its destinations
without hindrance," he told the Times.
    The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia
exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and
17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic
sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's
ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam
without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in
Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes
to get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.
    In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee,
Baker said that he had given that message to Brazilian
officials earlier this month when they met for talks in
Washington.
    He said that the so-called Cruzado Plan had worked for a
while, but that new efforts by the government are now required.
    Baker made it clear that he backed the decision by the
Paris Club official creditors to reschedule loans to Brazil,
even though the country later froze its payments to commercial
bank creditors.
    He said that the official loans are being serviced and that
this was a result of the rescheduling.

<TITLE>K MART &lt;KM> ENDS TALKS TO SELL STORES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>K Mart Corp said recent talks to sell
65 remaining Kresge variety stores and their underlying real
estate to F.W. Woolworth Co &lt;Z> have ended.
    Robert Stevenson, K Mart vice president, told Reuters the
talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to
give a reason.
    Kresge is the forerunner of what is now the K Mart chain.
The name was changed to K Mart in 1977, Stevenson said.
    "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate
division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our
properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.
    The 65 Kresge stores that are scattered around the country
in downtown and suburban locations, he said.
    Stevenson said K Mart will continue to operate the stores.
"The stores are profitable. The only decision K Mart has made
is that we will continue to operate them," he said
    Kresge had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.

<TITLE>U.K. GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct
at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by
the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged
when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,
Lawson said.
    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling
M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be
taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as
the exchange rate.
    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to
the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the
corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business
sector in particular.
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the
PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN FEED OUTPUT SEEN DECLINING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German feedstuffs production is
expected to decline further after it dropped to 16.5 mln tonnes
in 1986 from 16.7 mln the previous year, the West German Feed
Stuff Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
West Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffs
sector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around
75 pct in 1986.
    He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milk
quotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and to
cheaper imports from abroad.
    "Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation,"
Wagner said. "In the long term we expect annual production to
decline steadily."
    The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by
0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnes
from 3.23 mln, he said.
    Wagner predicted that the sales volume in feed for dairy
cattle will decline even more this year because of the further
cut in milk output from April.

is undertaking a review of the long-term effects on securities
markets of computer-driven trading techniques known as program
trading.
    The NYSE said, "The study will review major new trading
techniques involving programmed portfolio hedging and index
arbitrage for their potential benefits and risks to the
financial system.  It will also explore the regulatory
implications of these trading techniques and whether their
increased use could possibly lead to market abuse."
    The exchange said a final report is expected before the end
of 1987.  It said program trading is becoming increasingly
important as a market factor.

<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Phoenix Canada Oil Co Ltd> said it
intends to appeal a ruling in U.S. Federal District Court of
Delaware on its suit against Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, Chevron Corp
&lt;CHV>, Chevron's Gulf Oil unit and their Ecuador subsidiaries.
    The court ruled against Phoenix's claim that a royalty it
held should have entitled it to a share of the 160 mln U.S.
dlrs paid to the defendants when they sold 62.5 pct of their
working interest in Ecuador oil operations, Phoenix said.
    However, the court did award Phoenix 1,250,000 Canadian
dlrs in underpayments, the company said.
    Phoenix Canada Oil said the fiduciary relationship that
existed between Phoenix, as the royalty owner, and the
defendants, as the working interest operators, was fundamental
in the oil industry and was not reflected in the court's
ruling.

<TITLE>CONSERVATIVE GAINS MAY SPEED FINNISH MARKET REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Simon Haydon, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conservative gains in Finnish general
elections could speed liberalisation of financial markets,
though there will not be a radical economic restructuring,
conservative officials and economic analysts said.
    The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after
the two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political
commentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is
likely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.
    International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: "we are
willing to liberalise the economy as much as possible."
    Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition
had introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its
period of government between 1983 and 1987.
    They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to
other European conservative movements and had, for example,
shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.
    Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties
with its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right
coalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.
   The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade
must be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January
agreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.
    Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude
oil accounting for 80 pct of imports.
    The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno-
Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim
exports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.
    Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the
election news, with little movement in the markka or on the
Helsinki stock exchange.
    Securities analysts said the market would respond positively
if a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too
early to exclude the possibility that social democrats would
hang on to power.
    The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation
governing the stock market to prevent "casino-style behaviour."
    He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment
of an internal market between the Nordic countries.
     International capital markets were becoming more and more
important, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the
development of Finland's capial markets.
   He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties
with Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be
studied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade
Association ( EFTA).
    Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties
are likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new
government will probably not be established before the start of
April.
    Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained
three to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56
seats.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp may place its
long-term loans to Brazil on nonaccrual status if Brazil
continues to defer interest payments on the loans, the bank
holding company said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Brazil currently
total about 2.7 billion dlrs, including about 1.5 billion dlrs
in long-term loans and 1.2 billion dlrs in short-term loans.
    The Brazilian government announced in February its
intention to stop paying interest temporarily on its long-term
public and private sector commercial bank debt.
    "Continued deferral of interest payment on these obligations
could result in the loans being placed on nonaccrual status,"
the banking firm said.
    BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Mexico currently
total about 2.5 billion dlrs, of which about 215 mln dlrs of
loans have been reported as either nonaccrual or past due 90
days or more.
    Outstanding loans to Venezuela currently total about 1.3
billion dlrs, of which 241 mln dlrs of loans have been reported
as either nonaccrual or past due 90 days or more, it said.

likely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings
compared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said.
    Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were
largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the
effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S.
Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters.
    The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not
been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary &lt;Merx
HandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from
the oil market. The firm will announce 1986 results in July.

<DATELINE>    BONN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The proposed European Community (EC) tax
on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the
agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the
West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
the West German feed industry believes the EC does not
seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it
would end in another transatlantic trade war.
    "We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the
Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."
    American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne
Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers
were confident the tax would be rejected.
    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on
a lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on
Thursday and Friday.
    There are indications the Bonn government will also reject
the proposed tax, Wagner said.

<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON> MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil
company, said in a published interview today that it was
reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to
close on of its french refineries.
    Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
during the interview.
    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
improvement in the European refining situation, its future
profits there should be good.
    "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
earnings," Mlotok said.
    "Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD>, they are seen as one of the
highest grade refiners in Europe," he added.
    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
these producers move further into downstream operations.
    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
refineries.
    PIW said "sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European
refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last
year."

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's response to protests by U.S.
Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC)
tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging,
American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman George
Fluegel said.
    Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer
delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told
Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the
Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded
much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the
proposed tax.
    Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative
response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the
attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."
    He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S.
Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the
EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.
    Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against
the proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the information
we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans,
hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark." His delegation also
hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.
    Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might
take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved,
Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could
be involved.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC
yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the
tax.
    ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The
Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed
tax would be rejected.

for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs
to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli
Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be
increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.
    The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level
of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in
80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985
level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in
force, the ministry said.
    Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000
tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82
pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or
48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.

    S and P cited continued poor operating performance of
Chi-Chi's 200 Mexican food restaurants and the company's
planned repurchase of up to three mln of its common shares.
    Chi-Chi's posted a third-quarter loss of 10 mln dlrs,
including a 20 mln dlr pretax loss from the disposal of 21
company-owned restaurants as part of a restructuring plan, the
rating agency noted. Profitability has fared poorly for three
years, mostly because of intense competition, S and P added.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Societe Generale de Belgique &lt;BELB.BR>
said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large
part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp.
    The company, which announced a net non-consolidated profit
of 5.31 billion francs compared with 2.82 billion in 1985, said
its current profits rose by 19 pct last year, without giving
further figures.
    However, it added in a statement that the company made
major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular
from the sale of Genstar shares.
    Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November's
annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5
billion francs, including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco
Limited &lt;IMS.TO>.
    He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion
francs after a rough balance in 1985.
    In today's statement, Societe Generale gave no figures for
extraordinary gains.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal by two U.S. House
Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and
medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a
House subcommittee today.
    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said
Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture
Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the
first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."
    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron
Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs
per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive
deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.
    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
years, protect family farms and eliminate government
accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
halted.
    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would
"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
family farmer is."
    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program
payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.
    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill
would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and
therefore eligible for payments.

important as a market factor.

    It said the Court order prevents Zico from buying any

17, 1987.
    In the tender offer blocked by the Court, Zico offered to
buy 500,000 shares, or about 22 pct of Bancroft's outstanding
stock, for 30 dlrs a share.
    Previously, Zico had bought 965,000 Bancroft shares for 31
dlrs a share, giving it about 28 pct of the company. If the
recent offer had gone through, the Zico would have owned
slightly more than 50 pct of Bancroft's outstanding shares.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia will reintroduce a modified
foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a
new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard
Chivuno said.
    Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks
of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that
there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions
and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types
of business.
    The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to
distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine
the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end
of January.
    President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was
suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation
and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had
resulted.
    Business and banking sources said another reason for
suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on
foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful
bidders.    The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system
was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15
per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.
    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of
about nine kwacha per dollar.

    Taft said Theta requested that the company cooperate and

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAWSON OIL TAX BREAKS TO HELP NEW FIELDS - REVENUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil
producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging
developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost
opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland
Revenue said in a post-budget statement.
    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced
in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies
will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
not immediately available against other development
expenditure, the statement said.
    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
basin for which development
consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
liability.
    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
Revenue said.
    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
encourage general research into ways of reducing field
development costs, it said.
    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
stg a year, it calculated.
    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
    These included measures to allow companies to balance their
shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
past periods of allowance utilisation.
    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
so-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And its
continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
might also be encouraged, he said.
    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
year.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Eastern Corp's Texas Eastern
Gas Pipleline unit President Howard C. Homeyer said the company
is committed to cleaning up polychlorinated biphyenyls PCBs
from its pipeline system.
    In testimony before Sen. Frank Lautenberg's (D-N.J.),
oversight committee on Environment and Public Works, a press
statement said Homeyer said the company will work with the
Environmental Protection Agency to immediately clean up
contaminated sites.
    The New York Times today reported that the EPA knew as
early as the fall of 1985 about PCB contamination at sites
along the Texas Eastern pipeline, but took no action because
the company supplied insufficient information.
    According to the Times, Texas Eastern admitted burying PCBs
at 51 sites along its right of way.
    Homeyer told the committee, according to a statement, that
the cleanup will require cooperation among EPA headquarters,
six EPA regions and a dozen states to avoid delays.
    Texas Eastern officials were not immediately available for
comment.

weeks ago reported sharply lower first quarter earnings, plans
to slow its expansion to five to six pct annually from 15 pct
last year, Chairman Jack A. Robinson told Reuters.
    Robinson said after the company's annual meeting that Perry
also would slow its acquisition program, through which the
company has moved into the auto parts business.
     Although Robinson would not make a specific earnings
forecast, he said "We expect to regain our earnings momentum in
the second half of the current fiscal year, ending October 31."
    Perry Drug earned 13 cts a share in its first quarter this
year. It made 11 cts a share in last year's second half, down
from 51 cts in the 1985 second half.

<TITLE>ATT-PHILIPS BID FOR CGCT OUTLINED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co and
Philips Telecommunications BV (APT) would hold 36 pct through
direct and indirect holdings in France's &lt;Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques> if a joint bid with French
partners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, a
director at one of the partner firms said.
    Marc Mathieu of &lt;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>
SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT &lt;T.N.> and the
NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS>.
    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.
   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
close discussions within the government due to legal queries
over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry
official said.
    Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
foreign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and
&lt;Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled by
Algemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.
    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
francs by private tender.
    Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.
    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a
capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but
declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
foreign stakes in CGCT.
    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.
    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed
to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production
plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to
produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to
French standards.
    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
bidding among a wider range of applicants.
    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's
Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA &lt;SCHN.PA>
subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>British bank base lending rates are
likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
markets had already started to reward.
    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said.
    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
    "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
interest rates down," he said.
    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
half-point cut now.
    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
    "This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
such cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.
    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
"There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.
    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
base rate cut could be implemented.
 But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and I
suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
point off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.
    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
and government bonds (gilts) markets.
    But building societies said they would not cut lending
rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

index contracts to the stock market opening on expiration
Fridays providing the change is part of an industry-wide move
to a uniform system.
    "We believe it is in the best interests of the industry for
all markets to participate  in a coordinated move to base
expiration Friday settlement prices on the stock market
opening," Amex president Kenneth Leibler said in a statmenet.
    He said non-uniform procedures will lead to "market and
investor confusion."
    Leibler said expirations based on openings "appears to
offer greater opportunities than the close to most efficiently
handle any order imbalances which may occur on expiration
Fridays."
    He said the markets would have the remainder of the trading
day to correct any "price dislocations" that occur. Market
analysts have attributed some wide swings in the stock market
in part to arbitrage activity involving index options and
futures and individual stocks.
    Options on the Major Market Index and the Institutional
Index, which now expire at the close, are traded on the Amex.

<TITLE>OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The western industrialised nations have
agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE, BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar is near appropriate levels
against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall
could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world
economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said.
    Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association
conference current exchange rates of major currencies "can be
viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective."
    He said the recent Paris agreement on currency
stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five
and Canada may herald "an era of greater exchange rate
stability."
    The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up
permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed,
adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and
enforce on an international level.
    "At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered
grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and
the yen," Gleske said.
    He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies
of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and
Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary.
    But "a further dollar depreciation against major European
currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the
dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its
weighted external value," he said.
   In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would
hold two major dangers, Gleske said.
    First, in countries with large balance of payments
surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to
hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real
income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out
surpluses.
    Second, in the United States, it could damage investors'
confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to
finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske
said.
    Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international
system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in
narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such
targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, "both within
countries and between them."
    For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund
its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high
levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.
    If target zones were established, this would put "pressure
on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,
even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic
situation and priorities," he said.
    Gleske added, "targeting the exchange rate even within a
wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a
clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and
external policy priorities."
    Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its
chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current
interest rate differentials being maintained.
    These chances "seem to me to rest critically on the
expectation that the current configuration of interest rates,
and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth
financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead."
    Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had
learned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus
tend to overshoot." He said this "would seem to be unnecessary
and should be avoided if at all possible."
    Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if
markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will
lead to balanced international payments, he said.

    The facility would buy up some of the debt of less

    The facility was proposed by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., who
said it would help ease the third world debt crisis. It was
approved by the House International Finance subcommittee and

the measure next week.

<DATELINE>    LEVERKUSEN, West Germany, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German chemical
group Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it had received claims for damages
from haemophilics who allege they were infected with AIDS
through a blood plasma produced by a Bayer subsidiary.
    Bayer's shares fell 13 marks to close at 292 in Frankfurt
today. Dealers said a newspaper report about possible huge
claims for damages triggered off the share selling in Bayer,
other pharmaceuticals and insurance companies.
    Bayer said in a statement it was insured against claims and
had received two. Bayer did not rule out that some infections
may have been passed on through the plasma in the past.
    But the company added that the method of production had
been changed and according to current knowledge there was now
no danger of contracting AIDS through the blood plasma. The
plasma is used by haemophilics to aid the clotting of blood.
    The Hamburg-based news magazine "Der Spiegel" reported in its
latest edition that the West German pharmaceutical industry
could face billions of marks worth of claims for damages from
infected haemophilics and their relatives.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PLAYBOY &lt;PLA> HAS NO RESTRUCTURING PLANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Playboy Enterprises Inc said it has no
plans to restructure or to take the company private.
    Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the more
than 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling his
stock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said. 
    Articles in two weekly business publications have said
Playboy is a takeover candidate because of what financial
analysts see as its undervalued asset base.
    Radomski said there were no corporate developments to
account for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares but
that there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.
    Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnover
of about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock has
traded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.
    The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst Mark
Boyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrs
a share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about
130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its real
estate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs and
its excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs,
according to Business Week.
    According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansion
and artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share,
the Forbes Magazine article said.
    According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the most
recognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.
    Radomski, noting that the articles were written without
contact with Playboy, said that "from time to time people do
speculate about the company."
    She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner in
the "last day or so" for a reaction to the articles.
    American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes
"anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveraged
buyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances are
nil." Management has repeatedly stated it will not take the
company private, he said.
    But "shareholders who held the stock prior to all the
publicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money," he
said.
    Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset value
of the company is likely to exceed the current price of the
stock. "But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I take
management at their word," he said.
    While Playboy's cable television operation is considered a
drain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz sees
potential. "They do have a management plan for the cable
operation and the company as a whole," he said. "Were this plan
to, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity for
earnings is significant," he said.

earnings for the fourth quarter ended January 31 were affected
by the weak economies of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana,
resulting in a drop in net earnings to 5,415,000 dlrs or 92 cts
a share from 7,730,000 dlrs or 1.28 dlrs a share for the
year-ago quarter.
    The company also said sales on the West Coast were hurt by
late snows and poor skiing conditions.
    Same-store sales declined 3.2 pct for the quarter and 2.2
pct for the year.
    For the full year, Oshman's net earnings fell to 2,664,000

    In 1986, the company said it opened nine stores and closed

<TITLE>CHINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Light, scattered showers covered
winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended
March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy
in most central and northern areas, the Joint Agricultural
Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce
Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency
said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative
stage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North China
Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the
south.
     Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,
eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed
February's below normal precipitation pattern.
    The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided
ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for
irrigation. 
    Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi and
Guandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, it
said.

    In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency
said crop areas in Cordoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires received
only light scattered showers -- three to 13 millimeters.
     The beneficial drier weather allowed drying of fields for
summer crop harvesting, following February's heavy rainfall, it
said.

<TITLE>U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.

<TITLE>COASTAL (CGP) SEES INCREASE IN 1987 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coastal Corp said it expected earnings
for 1987 "to be significantly above" profits of 71.6 mln dlrs
last year.
    In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's
newly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt
did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to
increase.
    The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and
pipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping
energy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs
last year.
    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average
price of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the
previous year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average
14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.
    The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average
of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it
had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil
and 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Average reserve
replacement costs were 8.28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent
during the past three-year period, representing a little more
than half of the industry average, the company said.
    Coastal's more than 800 gasoline retail outlets were
operated profitably during 1986 "and are expected to continue
to do so," the company said.

<TITLE>U.S OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSA-CHAMPLIN DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>an eventual oil import fee in the
united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum
corp's joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de
venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.
    "this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all
eventualities in this regard," he told reuters during the
signing ceremony here.
    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa
buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as "one more
step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
world markets."
   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of
supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
    "we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
clear benefits to both sides," he said.
    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
obtain a competitive product yield.
    "therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
on today's agreement," adams said.
    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
to take advantage of bigger margins.
    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of
venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct
yield of white products.

Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting
companies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to the
Soviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said.
    Today's meeting, set to begin at 1500 EST (2000 gmt), was
scheduled at the request of the exporters, the aide said.
    "The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviously
one of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about, but
they haven't any agenda as far as I know," Lyng's aide said.
    Private industry export officials have met periodically
with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation.
Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue
of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is
uncertain, the aide said.
    "I don't know what they'll tell us that we don't already
knwo, but we'll hear what they have to say," Lyng's aide said.
    The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has
been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under
the EEP.

<TITLE>ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft
proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.
    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European
Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock
should operate, they said.
    The proposal involved three key principles. First, the
buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather
than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.
    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could
comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third
laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager
would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be
set by a formula, the delegates said.
    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met
briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all
consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction
to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group
meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.
    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to
work from, one consumer delegate said.
    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for
negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.

<TITLE>GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance and economy ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to
discuss further economic integration, officials said.
    They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank
governors on a common currency exchange rate.
    The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which
to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be
forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in
Saudi Arabia late this year.
    The six states have different currency systems. Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the
International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the
special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar.
    Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while
Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by
itself.
    The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not
been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be
linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket.
    Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of
State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint
economic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests of
GCC citizens together."
    The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met
in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's
Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim
    The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic
and investment projects in the GCC.
    Officials said the corporation's assets rose to 1.31
billion dollars last year from 1.04 billion at the end of 1985.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dry weather pushed further into
South Africa's Orange Free State's Maize Triangle in the week
ended March 14, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the
U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
    In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency
said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal, but dry
pockets persisted in the northeast and south.
    Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal
throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in
areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said.
    The agency said rainfall during February was near to above
normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather
reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and
southern Orange Free State.

<TITLE>U.K. BUDGET SEEN BOOSTING GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget contained virtually everything the government
bond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices
race ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.
    Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his
speech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely
sharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose
about two points on the day.
    "This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,"
Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.
    Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the
budget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial
bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point
tomorrow.
    Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection
of supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget
was that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held
to 4.0 billion stg.
    By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion
stg.
    The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer
far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and
the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further,
analysts said.
    "The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically
expected," Bell said. Most market expectations called for the
Chancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.
    S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said
that overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less
in new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in
total new issue volume.
    Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy
Wrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion
stg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap
issues.
    The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full
price does not have to be paid until the start of the new
fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current
year's fund raising.
    But the Bank of England will also be constrained from
issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try
out a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new
stock.
    The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked
issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail
Price Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to
be raised in the form of traditional stock.
    Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two
pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line
with most market expectations, although some operators had
expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.
    The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut,
Shepherd said, because "If it was more than two pct, they would
have become concerned about the economy heating up again."
    Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the
ruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut
can be offered at budget time next year.
    Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam
on the political implications of the budget which suggests an
early election.
    "All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the
middle of May," Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. "This makes a June
election very likely."
    Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from
the budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of
mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on
pensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.
    At that rate, they would have been of little use for a
political party expecting to call an election in June.
    Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with
measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.
    "This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour
party to attack," Shepherd said.

<DATELINE>    TRAIL, British Columbia, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd said it was
in the second round of two-week-old negotiations with about
3,200 unionized workers at its Trail and Kimberley, British
Columbia zinc-lead operations.
    The existing two-year contracts expire April 30. The
workers are represented by the United Steelworkers of America.
    A Cominco spokesman, queried by Reuters, declined to
comment on whether the company was confident of reaching a new
agreement before April 30, but said the union had not yet taken
a strike vote.
    The contracts cover 2,600 production workers at Trail and
Kimberley and 600 office and technical staff at the two
operations.
    Trail produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long
tons of lead in 1986. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced
2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the
Trail smelter.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Citizens Utility Board said it will
file a class action suit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court
against Commonwealth Edison Co, seeking refunds of 150 dlrs a
customer for consumers who have been paying what it calls "the
wrong monthly customer charge" for the past two years.
    The suit comes in the wake of an Illinois Commerce
Commission decision dismissing a class action complaint
Citizens Utility Board filed with the commission in September
on behalf of consumers who had been overcharged.
    It said the overcharges stem from Edison's monthly customer
charge, which is supposed to be 11.24 dlrs for those who live
in single family homes or buildings with two units and 5.65
dlrs for people living in buildings with three or more units.

<TITLE>WORLD CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dry weather covered most European
crop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those in
southwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and
Commerce Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency
said mixed rain and snow covered Greece.
    Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy
remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March.
    Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in
early April, it said.
    Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas
of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said.
    Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central
India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by
late April.
    Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India,
reversing February's below-normal trend.
    Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most
southern areas, it said.
    In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the
central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon
and southern Mindanao.
    Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as
rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands.
    In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding
in Java, it said.
    The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan
winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said.
    Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to
Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in
Southeast Asia.
    Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and
central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet
crop demands, it said.
    Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained
adequate moisture for crop growth, it said.
    Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as
winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase,
the agency said.

<TITLE>ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Simon Cox, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
    "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner,
U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It was
a very, very prudent fiscal budget."
    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
    As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment"
between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
27 pct.
    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
one-point cut tomorrow.
    "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
it will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added a
further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
    Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
    "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"
he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
inflation.
    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
it was "not a good budget for inflation," he said
    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
too concerned about a revival of inflation.
    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
"leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
signs of excessive weakness.
    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
to be 4.0 billion stg.
    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
which has to be held before June, 1988.
    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
    But others said it kept several options open and it was not
possible to deduce too much from it.
    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
that there would be no "chickens coming home to roost."
    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

<TITLE>TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
would agree to a takeover.
    "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.
    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
dlrs per share.
    The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
made on a sale of the company.
    "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
share)," said one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
necessary for the broadcast properites.
    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
such as restructuring.
    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
years ago, has about 12 pct.
    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
    "I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
for 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but he
speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
than a price in the 160s.
    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
speculated the investor would not really be interested in
running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
buyout.
    "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
the interests involved," he said, adding the two largest
shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
broadcast industry.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE SEES CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL PICKUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France expects a continued
revival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for
any improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate
remains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review.
    The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the
agro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall
in January, while construction and civil engineering
experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the
next few months.
    Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in
particular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.
    Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception
of the agro-food industry, improved substantially.
    In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last
months.
    Production rose in all sectors except agricultural
machinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship
construction, where it declined.
    The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in
activity in February, with both domestic and export orders
rising.
    In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite
a fall in the household goods sector and stability in
pharmaceuticals.
    Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped
by a strong growth in construction materials.
    But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over
the past two months.

<TITLE>HERRINGTON SAYS HE MAY CALL FOR OIL TAX BENEFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil
industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and
head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend
to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels
per day.
    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a
day.
    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate
for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down
because of budgetary constraints.
    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might
advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax
benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and
development into new ways to extract oil which is now
considered uneconomical to produce.
    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the
Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.
    Herrington said that before he disclosed what
recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry
he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House
Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase
oil production made good tax policy.
    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one
mln barrels a day.
    The report said that by the end of the century the United
States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil
consumption, posing a serious economic and national security
threat.

    The facility would buy up some of the debt of less

<TITLE>U.S. WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.
    The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.

rates on boxcar shipments of manufactured products moving
between CSX points in the South and Conrail points in the

    Conrail said the prices, which were effective March one,
are expected to meet or beat comparable truck transportation
prices in virtually all target markets.
    It said the reduced prices also represent a simplification
of the prvious tariff-based rate structure, which used price
and milage scales to determine rates. The new prices are
constructed from a single table of origin and destination Zip
Codes.

<TITLE>OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC believes world oil prices should
be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today.
    In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar
in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes
...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions
and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."
    But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had
caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to
curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
states could not be sustained in some cases.
    "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member
countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
production," Al-Wattari said.
    "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"
Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,
some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.
    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
February, although this had meant sacrifices.
    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,
though restored to a good level, was still under pressure,
Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market
requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added.
    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a
political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.
    But although cutbacks announced by these states were
politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were
insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority
of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's
calls for supply regulation," he said.
    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for
otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price
would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.
    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also
addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed
to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.
    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation
would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Midway Airlines Inc, which has
frequently been mentioned as an acquisition target, said it
declared a shareholder rights plan.
    Holders will get a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right on each outstanding share of common stock.
    Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to
purchase one one-hundredth share of Series C Junior
Participating preferred stock for 50 dlrs.
    The rights are intended to assure that all holders receive
fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The company said
this is not in response to a known effort to acquire control.
    The rights will be exercisable 10 days after a person or
group buys 20 pct of the company's common, or announces or
commences a tender offer that would result in acquisition of 30
pct or more of its common.
    Midway can redeem the rights at two cts each at any time
prior to expieration of 10 days after the acquisition by any
person of 20 pct or more of the companyt's common, it said.
    If Midway is acquired, each right will entitle its hodler
to purchase a number of the acquiring company's common shares
having a market value at that time of twice the right's
exercise price.
    The dividend will be payable to holders of record April
six, and expire 10 years later on April 6, 1997.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA-ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela has still to work out final
details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per
day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports
caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela
(PDVSA) official said.
    "We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation
will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be
affected," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal
with Union Pacific Corp today.
    He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by
Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.
    He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be
considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters,
requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to
ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.
    Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as
saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and
remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at
a rate of 35,000 bpd.
    He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean
state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company
never allows third parties to trade its oil.

<TITLE>SURALCO ALUMINA EXPORTS DROPPED 75 PCT IN FEB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARAMARIBO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Surinam Aluminum Company
(SURALCO) registered a 75 pct drop in alumina exports in
February after its operations were shut down by worker violence
and guerrilla sabotage, the official Surinam News Agency, SNA,
reported.
    SNA said Suralco's alumina exports dropped to 23,869 tonnes
in February from 92,852 tonnes in January. Aluminum exports,
meanwhile, decreased nine pct in the same period, to 1,511
tonnes from 1,647 tonnes.
    Suralco's alumina refinery at Paranam, 18 miles south of
the capital, was shut down February 2 after workers destroyed
plant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the
company's nearby aluminum smelter.
    The smelter was shut down January 26 after anti-government
guerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit
power to the plant from the Afobaka dam.
    The alumina refinery, owned jointly by Suralco and Billiton
NV, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, was reopened March 9. But
the smelter remains closed, as do the Suralco mines at Moengo,
60 miles east of Paramaribo, which were closed down by
guerrillas last November.

<TITLE>BUDGET SEEN PAVING WAY FOR EARLY U.K. ELECTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The budget presented by Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as
being politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscal
prudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's
standing with both voters and financial markets.
    The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the
standard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg.
    Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a
fall in domestic interest rates and an early election.
    Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget "is
not glamourous - but it is sound and sensible."
    Lawson told journalists later that it was "a budget built on
success, for success."
    But opposition MPs did not agree .
    David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said "this was a
strangely deceptive budget.
    The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has
chosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we in
the SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use
those revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty."
    Steel said "the cunning thing in this seductive budget is
that all the good things will come in the pre-election period -
the fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, the
lower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettes
and petrol."
    David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping,
said "this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it
has failed in its objective. It has given money to the "haves" as
opposed to the "have-nots."
    Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it "a bribes budget."
    Kinnock said the budget "had little to do with the general
good, and everything to do with the general election."
    Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said
"the Tories should have used available resources to invest in
industry, in health and in education."
    He added that "we know that whoever is elected (to power in
the next general election) will reverse these tax cuts."
    But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury
expected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for
use in cutting taxes or raising public spending.
    Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the
government would be forced to call an election by a
deteriorating economy.
    In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said
that "the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than
it has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh
year of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been
combined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and
strong, and unemployment is falling."
    He said that "these are the fruits of the government's
determination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to
our policies of sound money and free markets."
    Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to
plump for an early election.
    Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would
have on election timing, he replied "I think we will hold the
election either late or early. I must confess I am rather
relaxed about it all.
    "There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.
    But he added that "if the Prime Minister decides to go for
an early election, it will bring to an end all this rather
ridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is
something to be said for that."
    Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said "This budget
will reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing
means lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI
wanted."
    "We have always said we would judge the budget on how it
affects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick."

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI SAYS TAX HIKE NEEDS REAGAN SUPPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he was ready to support an 18
billion dlr tax increase to help balance the budget but doubted
it could pass Congress without President Reagan's support.
    Rostenkowski, the chief House taxwriter, said his committee
was reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that it
would pass the full House and this would require Republican
votes.
    "Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unless
the president signs on," the Illinois Democrat said in remarks
for delivery to the Tax Executives Institute.
    Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate on
increases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income tax
intact.
    The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income tax
rate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in
1988, he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct
next year.
    In addition, he said "they don't have the energy or appetite
to endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),"
which he also opposes. "The real question is where the
Republicans will be when the tough vote comes," he said.
    Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax
credits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or
trade bill this year.
    He added that no extension or expansion of the research and
development tax credit for business is expected since it would
cost billions of dollars.
    And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Baker
as Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the White
House will ultimately back a tax increase this year. "There are
strong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the president
down the slippery slope of moderation," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Surprisingly strong U.S. housing
statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that
the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient
cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,
economists said.
    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually
mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that
seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the
economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And
after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.
    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804
mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April
1986.
    The rate at which permits were issued for future building
climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764
mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.
    "February's weather is usually more adverse for home
building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to
determine what this means for the economy down the road," said
Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for
weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures
inflate the statistics.
    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to
building last month. But several believe that rates will now
consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.
    "Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying
'Let's do it now'," said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much
of the financing for home building.
    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward
potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and 
some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.
    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early
summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last
November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.
    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in
the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which
typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high
vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units
following tax law changes effective January 1.
    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317
mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.
    "Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low
mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not
looking at a great deal of growth potential," said Ward
McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with
larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial
output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers
to start waving "four pct GNP banners" for the first quarter.
Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.
    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to
come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not
convinced that growth will pick up in future.
    "The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on
now, not all of which is intentional," he said. For example,
U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,
produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February
compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.
    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first
quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker
growth in the second, he said.
    "If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building
and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then
there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"
agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating
first quarter GNP prospects.
    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that
current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.
    "At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the
first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the
second," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei
Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

<TITLE>U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Government forecasts that oil
revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
1985/86.
    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
tax is paid after a time lag.
    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
year.
    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
overshoot.
    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
fiscal year.
    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
164.9 billion in the current year.
    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and
overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in
1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury
said.

<TITLE>REYNOLD METALS &lt;RLM> UP ON FURMAN SELZ REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Reynolds Metals Co rose
sharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz and
Birney issued a report focusing on the strong earnings
potential from the company's Australian gold holding, traders
familiar with the report said.
    Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian
gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share
this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.
    Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of
729,500 shares.
    Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and
the Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. An
analyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties,
together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share
for Reynolds."
    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise
in the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investors
that were not completely cognizant of the size or the
importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia."
    Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was
discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.
Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.
    The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits
from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the
production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.
    Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings
estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share
in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.
    Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a
share, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new
accounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards
and other extraordinary items.

<TITLE>ALCAN &lt;AL> MAY MAKE SHARE ISSUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it may issue
up to two mln first preferred shares in addition to an
unlimited number of additional common shares and an unlimited
number of additional preference shares at any time after its
proposed reorganization.
    In a proxy statement, the company said shareholders are to
vote on the reorganization, which would result in Alcan's
wholly-owned Aluminum Co of Canada Ltd unit replacing Alcan
Aluminium as the group's parent company, at the April 23 annual
meeting. The new company will keep the Alcan Aluminium Ltd
name.
    Alcan said it has no plans to immediately issue any of the
additional shares.
    The company has said it is undertaking the reorganization
mainly to streamline management and give Alcan a stronger and
more stable financing base by making the new Alcan a major
operating company as well as a holding and management company.
    "In an increasingly global capital market, this new
structure should also provide for greater flexibility in
financing the Alcan group," the company said.
    Alcan's current only outstanding securities are common
shares while the new company would have outstanding securities
of common, preferred and preference shares, and its debt.
    Each shareholder would automatically become a shareholder
in the new company without exchanging share certificates.
    Alcan later said it has a provision identical to the one
detailed in the proxy statement allowing for the issue of
preferred, common and preference shares, in its existing
corporate structure.

<TITLE>HYDRO-QUEBEC IN HEARINGS FOR U.S. POWER EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hydro-Quebec, the provincially-owned
utility, said it is appearing this week before the National
Energy Board to defend its application to export about five
billion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the New England
states.
    The contract with the New England Power Pool was signed in
1985 and runs from 1990 to 1999. A spokesman for the Quebec
utility said hearings are normally held on major contracts up
to two years after the deal is signed.
    Hydro-Quebec, which last month agreed to sell 15 billion
dlrs worth of power to Maine starting in 1992, has to convince
the board the electricity is surplus to Canadian needs.
    Utilities in at least three Canadian provinces have said
they are opposing the New England deal. The Ontario and New
Brunswick utilities said they are objecting because
Hydro-Quebec did not offer them the electricity before going to
the New England Power Pool. New Brunswick said it is also
concerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. export
markets.
    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said several
provinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate a
power agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebec
utility's export contracts.
    Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changes
to contracts in the past but has always left the agreements
essentially intact.
    He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whether
it believed the board would call for substantial changes to the
agreement with New England.
    He said the hearings, which began today, will probably last
two or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.
    Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from export
contracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteed
amounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC believes world oil prices should
be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC
Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said.
    In a speech to a European Community/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in
Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said, "OPEC believes ...the
world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and
should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."
    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in
February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of
these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored
to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said.
    "A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider
scope of international cooperation," he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House of Representatives
approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
they did not plant.
    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
broad-scale revision of farm programs.
    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
deficiency payments they would have received.
    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
different crop on that land this spring, although they could
use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
last fall's flooding.
    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
by Congress last fall.
    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
alternative to federal disaster assistance.
    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
savings.
    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
dlrs.
    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
dlrs.
    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
on the disaster assistance program.

per share for first quarter fiscal 1987 to March 31 to be about

    He told a news conference the company expected costs for
its first 10 all-suite hotels, announced today, to be about 150
mln dlrs. Initial financing would come from the company's cash

<TITLE>H.J. HEINZ &lt;HNZ> POISED FOR RECORD YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.J. Heinz Co is "within sight of our
22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" for
the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.
    O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said
the food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-year
history."
    Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55
cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion
dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.
    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big
brands, new products and services, new geography, internal
growth and acquisitions.
    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in
history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive
said a volume falloff in the overall product category "is a
concern to us."
    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and
will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln
dlrs.
    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to
build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture
with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which
produces dry baby food cereal.
    He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating its
first substantial dividends," and implementation of a new
partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new
manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,
South Korea.
    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz
implemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted at
manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.
    He said a modernization program is in effect at the
company's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,
trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced
to 2,500 in 1988.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>An attorney was named today in a
24-count federal indictment alleging he initiated an insider
trading scheme which allowed friends and relatives to make
nearly 1.5 mln dlrs in illegal profits on non-public knowledge
of a corporate restructuring.
    Israel G. Grossman, 34, who had been a pension specialist
for the New York firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen and Kamin,
allegedly stole information from the firm involving the
recapitalization of Colt Industries Inc &lt;COT> last July.
    Grossman, who was arrested February 17, allegedly enabled
three individuals whom he alerted to purchase 1,006 colt call
options for 33,938 dlrs.
    July 21, the day after the Colt recapitalization was
announced, its common stock rose almost 27 points. The options
increased to a value of about 1.5 mln dlrs, according to
Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, who announced the
indictment today.
    Grossman is charged with 12 counts of mail fraid and 12
counts of securities fraud. If convicted, he could be sentenced
to a maximum of 120 years in jail and fined a total of six mln
dlrs.
    Grossman resigned from the law firm following his arrest.
He is scheduled to enter a plea March 26.

<TITLE>ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE &lt;ABEV> EXPLORES UNIT SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHEVERLY, Md., March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
    The group includes senior management of Service America but
no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
    The company has agreed to permit the group and its
potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
America, it said.
    Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
off the foodservice subsidiary.
    The company said the group's review is preliminary and
there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
or, if made, accepted.
    Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
    He declined to identify the Service America officials in
the acquisition group.
    On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
    Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
office and furniture operations.
    In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
&lt;PEP> for 160 mln dlrs.
    Including discontinued operations and the special item, net
income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

Pro forma debt leverage drops to about 30 pct from 67 pct at
September 30, 1986. But S and P said Valero's refining segment

<TITLE>PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Lima, march 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms
to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among
government-owned companies.
    Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others
would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino,
president of the government's state company holding firm, the
national development council (conade).
     He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to
slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion
intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all
or part of the companies.
    Independent economists warn that the deficit could push
inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the
govenment target of 40-50 pct.
    Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline
with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private
investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in
eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.
    Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said
the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,
including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock
exchange.
    Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the
possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another
manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold
in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern
state of  arequipa.
    Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique
estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners
would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries
said they were out of their offices.
    Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima
stock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be
sold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase
stock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.
    He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad
until at least july 1988.

<TITLE>DANA &lt;DCN> DEBT MAY BE DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade 700 mln dlrs of debt of Dana Corp and its unit,
Dana Credit Corp.
    The agency said its review would focus on the implications
of Dana's aggressive balance sheet management on liquidity and
financial flexibility. Moody's will also take into account
intensifying competition and pricing difficulties in Dana's
highly cyclical core truck and industrial markets.
    Dana currently carries A-2 senior debt and industrial
revenue bonds. The Prime-1 commercial paper of Dana and its
credit unit are also under review for possible downgrade.

<TITLE>FINANCIAL TIMES LAUNCHES NEW WORLD SHARE INDEX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Financial Times newspaper said it
has launched a new international share index, which represents
more than 70 pct of the world's total stock market value. The
FT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today,
feature a main world share index and indices plotting the
movement of share prices in different regions and individual
countries, the FT said.
    The first world share indices will be published on an
up-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices of
around 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.
    Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indices
for UK securities, the indices will be produced daily and
published in the Financial Times. The daily tables have a
series of regional indices together with the overall world
index.
    The FT said its main aim was to provide a set of
measurements against which the performance of international
fund managers could be judged. Markets, companies and
securities have been included only when direct holdings of
shares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT said
to keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number of
companies from the U.S. To 600.
    The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies -
the US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.
    The regional indices are calculated in a way that takes
into account the relative weight of local capitalisations.The
gross dividend yield is also published on the basis of what
foreign shareholders are entitled to receive before withholding
taxes.
    The FT said it has decided to calculate these numbers after
the enourmous growth in the volume of cross-border equity
investment in recent years.

<TITLE>NYSE CLARIFIES TRIPLE WITCHING PROCEDURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York stock exchange said its
rules for triple expiration Friday permit entering
arbitrage-related market-on-close orders in the final 30
minutes of trading providing they are on the other side of
imbalances and providing they open positions.
    The NYSE clarified a statement released yesterday in which
it detailed procedures to be followed this Friday when stock
index options, index futures and individual stock options
expire simultaneously. The NYSE said it will not allow a
market-on-close order after 1530 EST Friday that increases or
liquidates an existing arbitrage position.
    The NYSE in cooperation with the Securities and Exchange
commission will publicize imbalances of 10,000 or more shares
in the 50 stocks beginning at 1530 EST Friday. In the final 30
minutes of trading Friday any market-on-close orders must be on
the other side of the imbalance.

<TITLE>U.S HOUSE BUDGET CHAIRMAN PROPOSES SPENDING HOLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Budget Committee Chairman
William Gray, D-Pa, said he would propose a freeze on all
spending for federal government programs for the fiscal 1988
budget to meet budget deficit targets.
    "An outlay freeze -- with no additional revenues -- produces
almost enough savings to reach the 108 billion dlr deficit
target. For fiscal 1988, this would mean total spending of just
over 1 trillion dlrs," Gray said in a statement.
    Gray said his plan would call for a freeze in spending on
each individual federal program at fiscal 1987 levels.
    He said this would mean numerous program cuts, lower
benefits for recipients of federal assistance and fewer people
being served by federal programs.
    Gray said he would make the budget freeze proposal when the
House Budget Committee begins work on the budget resolution
this Thursday. The Senate Budget Committee began work on its
budget resolution this afternoon.

<TITLE>NO POLICY FOR OR AGAINST CERTIFICATES -- OMB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Office of Management and
Budget does not have a policy position one way or another on
whether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificate
program should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.
    Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association's
annual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agricultural
branch, said instead of an across the board policy for or
against certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to work
very closely with USDA in determining how many certificates
should be sent out in each government farm payment.
    "Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and the
Congressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can and
do increase budget exposure," Landis said.
    But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous
beneficial impacts.
    These benefits are helping maintain U.S. price
competitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the
government storage and handling costs.
    The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that
they increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of
the pik and roll marketing strategy.
    In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under
loan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference
between the price he paid for certificates and the county loan
rate.
    However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added
costs, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the
program.
    "OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on the
market, but the question is do those positive benefits outweigh
the added costs. If they do, then the certificate program is
good," an OMB official told Reuters.
    Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificate
worth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings for
wheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs for
soybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefit
of about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.
    But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggest
that an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released to
the market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash for
every dlr released in certificates.
    OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto
the market could cause prices to drop too low and government
costs to increase too much.
    But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of
certificates would be excessive.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community may decide to
increase the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend its
scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission's 1987/88
farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye,
vice-president of the British agricultural merchants'
association UKASTA, said.
    At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy
remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feed
manufacturers' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if its
controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils
and fats tax are blocked
    Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy
"tooth and nail."
    However, a test case in the European Court of Justice
contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the
levy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers'
organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until the
end of 1987, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Washington, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>From April through December 1986,
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
certificates has been authorized for issuance during
January-August, 1987.
    These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
    Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
more competitive on world markets, it said.
    The department said last summer, for example, certificates
were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
would have otherwise.
    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
to 50 mln bushels, it said.
    The department said government spending on farm programs in
fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
    The department said the President's budget proposals for
1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
billion dlrs.
    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
average of 1980-86, it said.
    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
years, the department said.

<TITLE>FAVOURABLE TAX TREATMENT GONE ON CERTAIN UK LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>An Inland Revenue ruling accompanying
today's U.K. Budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatment
on certain foreign loans by British banks and may be a
"nightmare" of practical application, banking sources said.
    This is because banks will only be able to offset the tax
credit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest they
receive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specific
loan. Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks
profits as a whole.
    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a
nightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.
    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change
are those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin
America. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were
involved expect to suggest it was a "sizable number."
    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made
on or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest
arising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the
measures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.
    Government sources noted that the existing treatment of
withholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce
interest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue
to the U.K. Treasury.
    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the
subsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and
bring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas
competitors.
    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the
Treausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over
time from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.
    But while compliance with the new measures could
necessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return
to the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.
    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans
contains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the
tax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent
the loans would and could be changed.
    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland
Revenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these
loans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a
minimum.

    The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into

its statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers.
The report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the
fee would reduce tax revenues. "A five dlr (per barrel) oil
import fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and
investment, " and raise revenues, he said.

<TITLE>FARM PROGRAM CHANGES OUTLINED BY USDA OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Upcoming changes being considered in
the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan
programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
    Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator
for USDA's state and county operations, said the following
changes are under consideration by USDA.
    Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for
wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week.
    Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under
consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not
made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain
in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
    Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next
year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans
partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.
    VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop
program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time.
    He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus
under the Conservation Reserve Program.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>There will be seven to eight billion
dlrs of generic certificates on the market by the end of
harvest, an Agriculture Department official said.
    The Commodity Credit Corp will "depend heavily" on
certificates to relieve storage problems this year, Ralph
Klopfenstein, Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations,
USDA, told participants at the National Grain and Feed
Association's annual convention.
    Klopfenstein said that CCC will not be able to relocate
grain in any significant amount this fall, so certificates will
be used in various programs to relieve storage tightness.
    Klopfenstein said certificates meet the goal of allowing
prices to go below loan levels and providing USDA with an
inventory management tool.

<TITLE>MAJOR U.S. FARM GROUPS OPPOSE POLICY CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Seven major U.S. farm groups took
the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging
congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law.
    Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee
Chairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a
statement saying lawmakers should "resist efforts to overhaul
the 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop
marketing year."
    The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau
Federation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's
Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton
Council, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice
Producers Legislative Group.
    The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm
bill "so the law might have its intended impact of making
agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the
same time maintaining farm income."
    "We strongly believe American farmers now need
predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to
have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing
decisions," the groups said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate Budget Committee, at its
first budget drafting meeting of the year, discarded President
Reagan's economic assumptions upon which he claims his budget
would show a 108 billion dlr deficit.
    In its place, the committee agreed to accept the non
partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic assumptions
in its deliberations for drafting a 1988 budget.
    The CBO says Reagan's budget--even if it were adopted
without change --would show a 134.4 billion dlr deficit in
fiscal 1988 and thereby miss the Gramm-Rudman budget law target
of 108 billion dlrs.

petitioning the International Trade Commission to lift import
taxes on Japanese motorcycle manufacturers.
    Harley-Davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to

tariff in April 1983 after Harley-Davidson convinced the
administration the Japanese were eroding the U.S. motorcycle
industry by flooding the market with its own models.
    Harley-Davidson said it has increased its market share of
the heavyweight motorcycle to 19.4 pct in 1986 from a record
low 12.5 pct in 1983.

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN PLANNING MINISTER RESIGNS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Planning Minister Joao Sayad
resigned, a presidential spokesman said.
    His resignation was accepted during a meeting with 
President Jose Sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.
    No official reasons for the resignation were immediately
available, but sources close to the government said Sayad had
pressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp government
spending cuts to combat inflation.
    Neither Sarney nor Finance Minister Dilson Funaro accepted
the proposals, the sources said.
    Sayad was one of the architects of last year's "Plano
Cruzado" program, which froze prices, ended widespread
indexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzado
currency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pct
annual inflation rate.
    After holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan was
unable to withstand the inflationary pressures of booming
consumer demand and widespread shortages. In the first two
months of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.
    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surplus
caused President Sarney to announce last month the suspension
of interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial
debt.
    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week new
measures to correct the economy would be announced within a
month, although he gave no further details.
    Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said 
Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to
get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.
    Sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in the
Brazilian cabinet.
    Presidential spokesman Frota Netto told journalists earlier
today the government was considering a suggestion by the Chief
of Civilian Staff at the Presidency Marco Maciel that a new
multi-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country's
current economic difficulties.

<TITLE>CONGRESSMAN URGES WHEAT EEP TO SOVIET UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kansas Republican Congressman Pat
Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export
enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union.
    Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee,
Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and
should also include the Soviet Union.
    Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue
of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan
administration recently because Secretary of State George
Shultz was out of the country.
    "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S.
Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service
administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply
to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge.
    Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the
USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow.
    "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.
    Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng's statement last week that "the door is not yet closed on
an eep to the Soviet Union."

for sertraline, a treatment for depression.
    In its annual report, Pfizer said that in addition to the
drug's anti-depressant action, sertraline is currently
undergoing studies to explore its ability to promote weight
loss. Company officials were not immediately available to
comment further.
    Eli Lilly and Co's &lt;LLY> Prozac, an antidepressant awaiting
marketing approval, has shown promise in promoting weight loss.
    Pfizer also said it plans to file for U.S. marketing
approval for certrizine, a "novel" antihistamine for hay fever,
and other allergic reactions.
    In 1986, Pfizer earned 660 mln dlrs or 3.90 dlrs per share
on revenues of 4.5 billion dlrs.

"hundreds" of its employees returned to work at its Dakota

    Last week, Iowa Beef said it would lift a lockout in effect

of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.
    Both union and non-union meatpackers who returned to work,
agreed to comply with Iowa Beef's last contract offer.
    "Start-up went well today and operations will continue to
pick up as employees return and others are hired," according to
a company statement. Picketing UFCWU members at the plant did
not disrupt operations, a company spokesman said.
    "Our employees are asked to continue to return to work at
8AM unless otherwise notified," he said.
    Iowa Beef, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp, said
it is beginning to take applications for permanent positions at
the plant.

<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;John Labatt Ltd> is considering
expansion in Europe, but has made no decisions as to strategy,
according to spokesman I.C. Ferrier.
    The company opened a London office about six months ago,
and "we are prepared to invest in that area to see how one might
do business over there," he said.
    But the company has not decided whether it might open
breweries, buy a European company or whether European expansion
is feasible at all, he added.
   Labatt feels Europe is a logical step for the company, since
it is doing "reasonably well" in the U.S. and "there aren't too
many other places" to expand profitably, Ferrier said.
    In Canada, Labatt is the leading brewer, with about 41 pct
of the market, according to market analysts. &lt;Molson Companies
Ltd> holds about 32 pct and &lt;Carling O'Keefe Ltd> has 23 pct,
analysts estimate.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>COURT BLOCKS INJUNCTION SOUGHT AGAINST COASTAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge ruled that
&lt;TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> can not seek an injunction in
Texas State court to block Coastal Corp &lt;CGP> from presenting a
plan of reorganization in TransAmerican's bankruptcy
proceeding.
    However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Manuel Leal also ruled that
TransAmerican could pursue its two billion dlr lawsuit against
Coastal that alleges the Houston based gas company is
attempting to unlawfully gain control of Transamerican's Texas
gas reserve and pipeline system.
    Leal told both Coastal and TransAmerican that he plans to
maintain jurisdiction over TransAmerican's bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings that began in 1983.
    After the hearing, John Nabors, a lawyer for TransAmerican,
said the company would pursue its state court lawsuit seeking
2.0 billion dlrs in damages from Coastal.
    Nabors contends that Coastal has unlawfully attempted to
replace TransAmerican's negotiated reorganization plan paying
secured creditors in full with a plan of its own.
    "They're not going to pay any money under their plan,
they're just going to operate (the gas wells) and give profit
to the creditors," Nabors said.
    He said Coastal's plan, which has not yet been submitted to
the Bankruptcy Court, offered to pay creditors 50 mln dlrs
annually for seven years.
    TransAmerican's plan would repay a total of 770 mln dlrs in
debts to secured creditors and the equivalent of 30 cts on the
dollar to unsecured creditors.
     A Coastal unit is among Transamerican's unsecured
creditors and is owed about 600,000 dlrs.
    Transamerican said it is the second largest producer of
natural gas in Texas with reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet
and more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
    Coastal, one of the nation's largest gas producers, earned
71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>LYNG SAID TO HAVE NO COMMENT ON USSR WHEAT EEP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain
exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a
position to comment on their request that the Reagan
administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union,
according to participants in today's meeting.
    "He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk
about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the
Soviet Union," said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National
Council of Farmer Cooperatives.
    Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be
identified, said Lyng was "unresponsive" to the group's request.
    Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc,
Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union Equity
Cooperative Exchange, the National Association of Wheat
Growers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, among
others, participants said.
    Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under
Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting.
    Hofer described Lyng as "sympathetic but noncommittal," and
said he thought he detected "a sense of frustration" on Lyng's
part at not being able to respond more positively to the
group's urging.
    A grain industry representative said some participants were
"puzzled" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the
cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
    "There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the
idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"
this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring
to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
    This official said there was not a significant amount of
pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP
offer to Moscow.
    Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an
offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone
calls from lawmakers on the subject.
    But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,
rather than an absence of political pressure, might have
restrained Lyng.

<TITLE>U.S. OTC MARKET PROPOSES ONE-SHARE, ONE-VOTE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Judith Crosson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of Securities
Dealers said all stock exchanges should require that listed
companies adopt a "one-share, one-vote" rule, but with a few
exceptions.
    In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD
President Gordon Macklin said the group would be happy to be
the first exchange to adopt a uniform rule but with certain
exceptions.
    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to do so. If
a voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, then
the commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,"
the NASD said.
    An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in the
OTC offered only one class of stock.
    The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have a
uniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equal
voting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.
    The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do not
have voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelled
out to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies from
turning voting shares into non-voting shares, without
shareholder approval, Parrillo said.
    "A uniform rule should be written to cure what has been
construed by some to be an abusive practice involving the use
of stock with other than full voting rights," the association
said in the statement.
    Exceptions would include:
    -- shares in a registerd public offering where all facts
connected with the company's capital structure are clearly
spelled out in the prospectus.
    -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition
or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied
by detailed proxy material.
    The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class of
stock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majority
of independent directors on the board approve the move. The
NYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dual
classes to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.
    The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dual
class shares where those with superior voting rights are not
resalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effect
prevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else.

<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Malaysian government has
deposited 405 mln ringgit with the financially troubled
&lt;Cooperative Central Bank Bhd> (CCB) since last October, Deputy
Finance Minister Sabaruddin Chik said.
    He told Parliament the government has always supported CCB.
The statement is the government's first acknowledgment that it
has put money into the bank.
    CCB's management board has been changed twice since last
June. It reported pretax profit of 10.57 mln ringgit in the
half-year to June 30, 1986, down from 19.83 mln ringgit a year
earlier. The bank did not release its net results.
    New bank chairman Nik Hussein Abdul Rahman has said he
asked police to investigate possible wrongdoing and
malpractices related to loans made mainly to property
developers and politicians.
    The bank had a paid-up capital of 52.16 mln ringgit and
deposits totalling 1.67 billion at June 30 last year.
    Malaysia's Central Bank has rescued two large commercial
banks, United Asian Bank Bhd and Perwira Habib Bank (Malaysia)
Bhd, since late 1986.

<TITLE>PAPER SAYS U.S. MAY SEEK TO CURB FOREIGN TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration will
consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive
industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York
Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.
    "I think there's a strong sentiment here that some
industries are not totally up for grabs," the paper quoted the
official as saying.
    "Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and
computer companies," said the official, who the newspaper said
was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd
&lt;ITSU.T> takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.
    The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and
industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan
administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition
in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.
    Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought
the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger
Ltd &lt;SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could
have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for
vital technology.
    The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had
come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.
    "Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have
to be some exceptions for the national interest," Baldrige was
quoted as saying.
    The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to
bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency
policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's
Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security
Council.

<TITLE>YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPAN'S FAVOURITE HORROR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>"Endaka," the strong yen, has usurped
"Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster" as Japan's favourite horror
story.
    The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two
years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon,
the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs
a month.
    But "endaka," like many Japanese products, is for foreign
consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said.
    "It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention to
the cost of living," said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old
Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo.
    Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by "chatting" 40
hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the
language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet
two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of
Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has
managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.
    She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating
out once a day.
    "For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes
with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso
soup, rice and tea," although she takes only coffee for
breakfast and a sandwich for dinner.
    No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents
see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by
foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.
    The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the
price to bring over the best people needed to back up their
push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.
    "You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and
trade down. It's not reasonable," said a spokesman for
International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports
Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.
    Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business
travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions
Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on
average more than 300 dlrs a day.
    While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,
many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to
visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.
    The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates "endaka" caused an 11.5
pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.
    Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by
curtailing shopping, it said.
    To help combat "endaka" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist
Bureau prepared a pamphlet, "Economical Travel in Japan."
    It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced
business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public
baths while getting a "revealing glimpse of Japanese in their
daily lives."
    Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's
Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.
    For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding
English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated,

    Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES SOCIAL SECURITY TO BUY SAN MIGUEL SHRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines' Social Security System
(SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer
&lt;San Miguel Corp> (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del
Rosario said.
    He told reporters the government organisation had expressed
interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to
invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a
share.
    The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block
of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank
(UCPB) and sequestered by the government.
    The block is split between class A and class B stock.
    SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.
Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres
Soriano, del Rosario said.
    The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
    Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are
open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to
unidentified foreign purchasers.
    He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to
resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.
    President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the
shares.
    Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit
Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
Good Government.
    The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the
real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former
chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of
deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

<TITLE>JAPAN EARTHQUAKE KILLS ONE, CUTS PHONE LINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, May 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A very strong earthquake which struck
southwest Japan killed one person and injured at least three,
cracked walls and cut telephone lines, authorities said.
    The quake, at 0336 GMT, registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, and officials issued warnings of tidal waves of up to
two metres high, they said.
    A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truck
overturned, and another was seriously hurt when his roof caved
in, police said. Two primary school children were hurt by
flying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom. The
extent of their injuries was not immediately known.
    A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki,
one of the worst hit areas, said walls cracked all over town.
    Weather officials told Reuters the quake's epicentre was 50
km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga, on
Kyushu's eastern coast.
    Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen along
the Kyushu coast to return to port, and dispatched a fleet of
six search boats to see them safely back.
    Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted and
all trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution,
police said.

<TITLE>INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL, FEARS MAY SHORTAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia has issued licences to
traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of
cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,
Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.
    "We have given permission for a small amount of imports to
prevent a shortage during Ramadan," he said. He gave no figures
for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would
come from Malaysia.
    Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,
earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.
    Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders
in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around
135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.
    Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest
Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and
have large meals after sunset.
    Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of
1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures,
against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.
    Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not
explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Millions of dollars in proceeds from
the sale of U.S. Arms to Iran were funneled to groups holding
American hostages in Lebanon, the New York Times said.
    The newspaper, quoting U.S. Officials and others, said
Iranian arms merchant Manucher Ghorbanifar, who served as a
middleman in the sales, deposited two to three mln dlrs in the
Swiss bank account of the Global Islamic Movement.
    The newspaper said the movement was a funding arm for
various terrorist groups in Lebanon, including the Party of God
or Hizbollah group which has been reported to be holding
American hostages but has consistently denied the reports.
    The money was described as ransom by American and other
associates of Ghorbanifar, the Times said, adding that an
unnamed American official called it "payments for services
rendered." The newspaper said the payments suggested the money
may have been used to cover expenses incurred by the hostages'
kidnappers.
    The newspaper also said that according to some accounts,
Ghorbanifar paid Iranian officials and various groups as much
as 10 mln dlrs. It said up to six mln dlrs went to Hojatoleslam
Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament, and his
family.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JEFF STEARNS, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>More U.S. And European firms will be
falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
    Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
Banks, steel and other businesses.
    In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's
biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
components for supercomputers.
    Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co
Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
banking, the takeover specialists said.
    Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
    Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
    "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal," a
takeover specialist at one trading company said.
    Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
    But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
the specialists said.
    Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
barriers against Japanese exports.
    Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
investment opportunity.
    "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
the recent economic factors have become a driving force," said a
banking industry source.
    So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
    While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
    Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
    Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
    A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.
Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
added.
    Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
but its graphic arts-related businesses.
    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
by the Japanese, the trading company official says. "Japanese
people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
deals." But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. "This is
a healthy progression."
    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
    "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
large U.S. Or European corporation," one banker said. "They will
expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
Japanese business."
    A foreign merchant banker also noted, "There are not many
mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
deals there have already been done."
    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
Japanese companies, the specialists said.
    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
high-technology areas. "Japanese companies had used technology
and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
from that trend," one takeover specialist said.
    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
    But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SAYS NO OPEC MEMBER VIOLATING OUTPUT QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali
al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC
member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the
13-nation group.
    Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba "All OPEC states,
without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to
them. Some of them are producing less."
    Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab
Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its
quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still
pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of
this year.
    Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but
an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected
its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems
marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.
    OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six
months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a
barrel from February 1.

<TITLE>CHINA TO CUT EXCESSIVE CAPITAL INVESTMENT FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>China said it will continue its efforts
to cut excessive capital investment, and noted policies to cool
the economy have so far failed.
    Fixed asset investment grew 16.7 pct to 296.7 billion yuan
in 1986, outstripping energy and raw materials growth, the
China Daily quoted Zhou Daojiong, president of the People's
Construction Bank of China, as saying.
    Over 160,000 projects costing 895 billion yuan are now
under construction, and will absorb 60 pct of the funds
earmarked for investment under China's current five-year
economic plan (1986-1990), he said.
    The state-run construction bank will review all investment
projects now under way or scheduled, and immediately halt those
deemed unnecessary or with a poor economic return, Zhou said.
    Over 20 billion yuan of unauthorised spending by local
governments or enterprises were partly responsible for the
overheated rate of investment, he said.
    Another two or three years of measures to curb excessive
investment were needed to bring it under control, Zhou said.

<TITLE>THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Vithoon Amorn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials of five Thai commercial banks
are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting
interest rates, banking sources said.
    They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur
domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity
on the money market.
    Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage
point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending
rates, they said.
    Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and
overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16
but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the
sources said.
    Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early
last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current
gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit
and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.
    Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about
40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created
problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.
    Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.
The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai
banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion
in bank deposits.
    Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have
further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.
    The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday
recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up
4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.
    Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register
more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.
    Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will
grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for
local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of
bank capital.
    If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry
date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign
exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.
    Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht
of surplus funds to the local money market.

<TITLE>CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HK>
forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over
the year-earlier period.
    The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co &lt;BA.N> 747
freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September
and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.
    It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit
to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14
cents a share.
    But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance
charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.
    A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft
deliveries in 1986.
    However, the company said in a statement good returns from
funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher
interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and
other borrowing.
    It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel
prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in
1985.
    Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last
year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre
travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But
passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.
    The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in
total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in
revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.
    Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now
50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> and 12.5 pct by
&lt;China International Trust and Investment Corp>.

<TITLE>GLOBAL TRADING IN YEN BOND FUTURES EXPECTED SOON</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Global trading of yen bond futures is
just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon
on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)
and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.
    "Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of
overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of
global trading of yen bond futures," said Katsuyuki Okayasu,
general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division.
    "But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus
for the LIFFE yen bond futures market," said Tetsuya Dezuka,
deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan
Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in
London.
    Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends
basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets
overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,
dealers said.
    Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around
140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.
    An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on
mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond
futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous
12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was
made with yen bond futures trading in mind.
    LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures
after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last
December.
    But futures markets will never take root unless they are
backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers
said.
    Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now
stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-
linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.
    "Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their
financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are
engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,"
Dezuka said.
    The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese
securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And
U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's
growth, dealers said.
    Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be
promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this
year, securities managers said.
    The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond
futures contract, they said.
    The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading
futures of designated foreign government debt securities not
located in the issuing country.
    Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, has
decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New
York as early as April.
    CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end of
April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura
Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still
obstacles to trading on the London market.
    "Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are
major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE," said Koki
Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's
bond administration division.
    Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese
securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE
on these matters.
    Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with
coupon payment of either March and September, or June and
December from April 1, matching futures delivery months.
    The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and
December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not
match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned
by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities
managers said.
    LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of
bonds with matching months increases to over several billion
yen, bond managers said.
    These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are
expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low
interest rates, they said.
    Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to
be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash
issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of
1987.

<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after
forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg.
    Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could
be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base
lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in
the discount market.
    Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today,
possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which
the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed
by three billion stg.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and
bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg
and 20 mln stg respectively.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add some 140 mln stg to the system today.

<TITLE>FRN TRADING SEEN RETURNING TO MORE NORMAL PATTERNS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conditions on the floating rate note
market appeared to be returning gradually to normal today with
prices static to a little better generally, dealers said.
    The market was showing limited signs of recovery from the
collapse in trading last night and the calmer tone was
reinforced this morning as the first significant retail orders
for some time emerged, one senior FRN trader noted.
    In fixed rate bonds, the tone was likewise quietly firmer
with euroyen and eurosterling maintaining their recent bullish
trend and activity in dollar straight and ECU-denominated bonds
also picking up slowly.
    Although a handful of FRN market makers were expected to
remain on the sidelines for the time being, dealers noted a
tangible return of retail interest from the Far East, lured
back by extremely attractive yields and bargain prices.
    "We are seeing from Singapore, and from Japan clients keen
to use up their quotas for purchase of particular instruments
before the end of the fiscal year," the senior trader added.
    Any investors not buying to their full limit would run the
risk of having that limit reduced next year, he explained.
    However, he pointed out that mainly sovereign paper was in
demand with U.S. Bank sector paper largely ignored.
    Prices of reasonable quality floaters had firmed by an
average of 10 basis points in early trading but FRN dealers
cautioned that the mood was still nervous.
    "If prices rise by too much too quickly, everyone is more
than well-aware of the danger the selling could set in again,"
commented another FRN market source at a large Japanese house.
    The other sector commanding market attention today was
eurosterling, which soared in line with U.K. Government bonds.
    Both markets were pushed higher by an ebullient pound and
renewed buying by U.K. Institutions following Chancellor of the
Exchequer's Nigel Lawson's well-received budget yesterday.
    "This was definitely a budget for lower sterling interest
rates," said a sterling analyst at a U.K. Merchant bank.
    "It has been exceptionally well-received by the city, looks
good to foreign investors and we are sure to see a rush to tap
the eurosterling markets now," he added.
    News that next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
will be held at 4.0 billion stg from an earlier projected 7.0
billion was influential for fixed rate stg investment markets.
The government's reduced need to tap the gilt-edged markets
will create a perennial shortage of stock, maintaining upward
pressure on prices, a sterling bond dealer commented.
    This could further boost demand for eurosterling bonds, as
long as yield margins remain attractive in relation to gilts --
often the case with newer, if not with more seasoned issues.
    Bullish predictions on the U.K.'s general economic health
were also expected to boost foreign interest in eurosterling.
    Market sources said attention would now switch to
monitoring the fortunes of the ruling Conservative party in
opinion polls ahead of a widely-anticipated general election.
    Although several new sterling deals are expected, in early
trading the only sterling denominated one to emerge was a 30
mln convertible deal for British Land Co Plc.
    Other new deals this morning reflected the recent primary
market trend with little activity in dollar-denominated issues
although the currency sectors were busy.
    Hot on the heels of yesterday's two Canadian dollar issues
was a 75 mln dlr six-year bond for Chrysler Credit Canada,
guaranteed by Chrysler Finance paying 9-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/2 pct.
    A 15 billion euroyen issue was launched for Associates Corp
of North America paying five pct at 102-3/8 pct due 1992. A
similar euroyen offering was reported to be in the market for a
Scandinavian borrower. Details were not immediately available.

<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Singapore government has taken
over 82 mln dlrs worth of Goodwood Park Hotel Ltd shares and
loan stock certificates belonging to the company's chairman,
Khoo Teck Puat, banking sources said.
    Khoo is a major shareholder of the &lt;National Bank of Brunei
Bhd> (NBB), which closed in November after the Brunei
authorities alleged 90 pct of its loans of 1.3 billion Brunei
dlrs had been extended to Khoo-related firms without
documentation or guarantee.
    The Goodwood securities are now held by the Commercial
Affairs Investigation Department, the banking sources said. The
department declined to comment.
    The government move is aimed at protecting Goodwood's
minority shareholders and securing Goodwood deposits at the
NBB, the banking sources said.
    Goodwood had a total of 87.3 mln dlrs in fixed deposits,
bank balances and accrued interest due from NBB as of last
November, according to Goodwood's annual report.

<TITLE>TURNER AND NEWALL SEEKS 71.7 MLN STG IN RIGHTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turner and Newall Plc said it planned to
raise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of
36.15 mln shares.
    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner's
price which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.
    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,
which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as a
result of the takeover of &lt;AE Plc>.
    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mln
stg from 39.6 mln previously.
    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment of
some 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowings
of some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year end
had risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. The
rights issue would cut borrowings and also allow further
development through investment and acquisition.
    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won after
a long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthened
the group's position in the automotive components and
engineering materials sectors.
    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of
27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 months
previously.
   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional until
December 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986
results.
    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forward
to taking advantage of the opportunities available.
   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart from
Zimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the local
currency against the dollar.

<TITLE>MALAYSIAN FIRM WINS U.S. JET SERVICE CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Airod Sdn Bhd> said it won a
contract from the U.S. Air Force to repair and service landing
gear and airframe parts of General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD.N> F-16
and McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD.N> F-4 jet fighters.
    The one-year contract, worth 1.3 mln ringgit, was signed
recently and work is expected to begin soon, an Airod spokesman
told Reuters.
    Airod is a joint venture between Lockheed Corp &lt;LK.N> unit
&lt;Lockheed Aircraft Service International> and &lt;Aerospace
Industries Malaysia>
    Airod, which was set up in 1985, has a paid-up capital of
5.6 mln ringgit, the spokesman said.
    He said that under the contract, jet parts from U.S. Air
Force bases in the Philippines, Japan and South Korea would be
sent to Airod for servicing and repair. If the Air Force was
satisfied with its performance, the contract could be extended,
he said. Airod now services some Royal Malaysian Air Force and
Indonesian Air Force aircraft, he said.
    Aerospace Industries is equally owned by the Malaysian
government, Malaysian Airline System &lt;MAIM.SI> and &lt;United
Motor Works Bhd>.

<TITLE>TOYOTA MOTORS SIGNS PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH PNB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The state-owned Philippine National Bank
(PNB) will fund Toyota Motor Corp's &lt;TOYO.T> planned purchase
of its bankrupt former local partner's manufacturing facilities
for at least 193 mln pesos, a bank official told reporters.
    Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to
produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner.
    It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the
manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate
about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years.
    The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three
weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government
agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over
by state-owned banks.
    Official sources said Toyota's application was likely to be
approved.
    Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20
years, &lt;Delta Motor Corp>, in 1984 because the local company
was suffering financial difficulties. PNB later foreclosed on
Delta's assets.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
those discount houses wishing to use borrowing facilities to do
so at 1430 GMT today at a rate of 10 pct for 14 days.
    This compares with the Bank's present band one dealing rate
of 10-3/8 pct.
    The Bank of England's announcement was quickly followed by
Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank which announced a
half-point cut in their base rates to 10 pct from 10-1/2 pct.
    Dealers said the lowering in base rates had been widely
expected following yesterday's U.K. Budget in which Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced a three billion stg cut
in the Government's public sector borrowing target for 1987/88
to four billion stg.
    Many in the market had expected a full one point cut in
base rates today but some were not surprised by the
authorities' caution, dealers added.

<TITLE>VEBA SHARE PLACEMENT STILL EXPECTED THIS MONTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The sale of the government's 25.55 pct
stake in VEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> is still expected this month, banking
sources closely linked with the transaction said.
    A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had
yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has
tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a
scandal at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses "has
nothing to do" with the timing of the VEBA sale.
    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for
later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.
    A banker involved in the VEBA placement said "Nothing has
changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take
place in the second half of March."
    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

<TITLE>SOVIET ECONOMIST SAYS PRODUCTION FIGURES PADDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leading Soviet economist said the
practice of padding figures was significantly inflating the
country's industrial production data.
    "According to the information of state monitoring organs,
the padding of figures makes up one-and-a-half to three per
cent of the volume of production," Alexei Sergeyev told the
official newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya.
    "In my opinion, it is significantly higher," Sergeyev, who
works at the Economics Institute of the Soviet Union's Academy
of Sciences, said.
    Most Western economists have for years allowed for a
certain padding of figures when analysing Soviet statistics for
industrial production.
    Sergeyev said about 600 mln roubles was lost annually in
raw material industries by paying wages and bonuses for work
which was not in fact performed.
    He said the elimination of figure-padding and other
malpractices would save billions of roubles and would pay for
the Soviet Union's social development program up to the year
2000.

<TITLE>SONY FORESEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> group net income is
expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31
from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if
the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing
director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
    Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550
billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.
    The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen
in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
    The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,
reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by
40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.
    Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units
in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while
Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one
mln due to lower exports to China.
    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three
months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.
    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total
production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.
    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month
period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
    Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group
net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April
1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net
profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a
year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.

<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>NV KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS>
is "absolutely not" negotiating a takeover of U.S. Regional
carrier Air Atlanta, a KLM spokeswoman said in a comment on an
article in the leading Dutch evening paper NRC Handelsblad.
    "U.S. Law requires that at least 75 pct of shares in a U.S.
Airline be owned by American firms or persons," the spokeswoman
added.
    The newspaper said that Air Atlanta, which flies to 11 U.S.
Cities, has a fleet of five Boeing jets with passenger capacity
of 110 and employs 400 people, is making losses.
    She said KLM had started talks with Vendex International NV
&lt;VENN.AS> on their jointly owned courier service XP Express
Parcel Systems, but declined to confirm an NRC Handelsblad
report saying it wanted to buy the Vendex stake in XP.
    KLM said last week it is negotiating a minority stake in
British courier service &lt;IML Air Services Group Ltd>, a
subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Plc &lt;BCOM.L>,
to strengthen its position in the fast-growing worldwide
door-to-door delivery market.
    The KLM spokeswoman said she expected further announcements
about the talks with Vendex to be made early next week.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FLENSBURG, West Germany, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German new car
registrations in February increased by 31 pct over January's
figure but trailed the February 1986 total by 2.9 pct, the
Federal Motor Office said.
    February new car registrations totalled 190,175 compared
with the year ago figure of 195,852 and last month's 145,122.
    New car registrations in January had fallen 41.6 pct
against December, reflecting the end of tax incentives aimed at
encouraging West Germans to buy cars with catalytic converters.
    The office said total February new vehicle registrations,
including those for trucks and buses, fell to 205,376 from
210,084 in February 1986 but were well above January's 157,357.

<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BABCOCK RIGHTS ISSUE PRICED AT 165 MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OBERHAUSEN, West Germany, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Babcock AG
&lt;DBCG.G> said an issue price of 165 marks had been set on a
two-for-five rights issue of shares which will raise nominal
capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    The subscription period for the offer runs from March 26 to
April eight, it added.
    Babcock shares opened at 222.2 marks in Frankfurt after a
close of 226 yesterday. Babcock, which has set an unchanged
three mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last
week that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.
These shares will be placed with institutional investors.
    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,
which share market analysts said was likely be used partly to
finance expansion, especially in environment technology.
    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major
Frankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to
bring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered
heavy losses in the early 1980s.
    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these
losses, which were due to problems linked with three major
contracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net
loss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.
    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its
results in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose
from the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.
    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the
pricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was
unfortunate.
    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in
VEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely
2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with
a large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener
insurance group.
    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has
generally put pressure on West German stocks which have also
suffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.
    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with
Iran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since
1975.
    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the
market took the news calmly. Analysts said today the
combination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not
have a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct
placement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors
both in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG URGES U.K. ENTRY INTO EMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German finance minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg suggested that the U.K. Should join the European
Monetary System (EMS) and also urged some member countries to
abandon their dual currency structures.
    Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee for
a Currency Union in Europe, whose key members are former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, founders of the EMS.
    He said, "One failing of the EMS is important countries,
like Great Britain, are not members. Other partners should give
up their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations."
    EMS member Belgium has both a "financial" and a "commercial"
franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct
against other member currencies, compared with a permitted
fluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies.
    According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech, the finance
minister also urged greater convergence of economic and
financial policies among European countries.
    He added that monetary stability should be a priority for
European countries and, with reference to the U.S. Dollar, he
said it was wrong to presume that a "permanent devaluation" was
the answer to economic problems.
    Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the
dollar in 1985. "But an overshooting in the other direction now
brings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. And
other countries whose currencies have declined," he added.
    He said such a development could also produce further
burdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreement
last month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise the
dollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, he
said.

<TITLE>ZAIRE AND IMF IN ECONOMIC RESCUE TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jean-Loup Fievet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KINSHASA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks are underway between financially
troubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed
at rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in
sub-Saharan Africa.
    Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that a
compromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks
enabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection of
cash.
    For its part the government is expected to increase
budgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attract
foreign investors, the sources said.
    "Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruled
out in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial
political and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors are
bound to come to terms soon," a Western diplomat told Reuters.
    "The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMF
assistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire's
strategic minerals fall into communist hands," the diplomat
said.
    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it
would limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to
10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.
    The government also announced an end to the floating
exchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed
parity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic
adjustments.
    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export
revenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the
copper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and
often extravagant investment projects.
    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth
largest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for
two-thirds of its export earnings.
    "A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing
everything for the sake of servicing its external debt,"
President Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he
announced his government's decision.
    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that "one does
not feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, one
toward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire," he
told diplomats.
    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed
austerity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital
without receiving appropriate financing from abroad.
    Economists said that since the large devaluation of the
zaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a net
outflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.
    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few
years reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross
National Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in the
world, banking sources said.
    Mobutu accused the IMF of "strangling" his country at an
October meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people
could not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.
    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the
IMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,
failed to materialise last year,
    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and
boosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,
    - substantial, additional financial help from the country's
traditional donors.
    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at
curbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashed
spending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Western
creditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.
    As a result, the overall economic and financial situation
improved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from
100 pct in 1983.
    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living
standards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread
discontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.
    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between
20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,
despite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced
last May.
    The World Bank has released in the last two months half of
a previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent
27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport
system.
    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading
partner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to
ease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts
for industry.
    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the
way for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting
of the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO ADOPT ITS LARGEST-EVER PROVISIONAL BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A parliamentary boycott by opposition
members has forced the government to compile its largest-ever
provisional budget, finance ministry officials said.
    The 7,900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of
fiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3,040
billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984.
    An on-again, off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition
parties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented
passage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year
ending March 31.
    The stop-gap budget, which is expected to pass parliament
on March 31, is designed to respond to mounting calls for
economic stimulus from domestic industries, hard hit by the
yen's sharp rise, officials said.
    It will include as much as 1,800 billion yen for public
works, about 30 pct of the 6,000 billion yen earmarked for such
works in the full budget. Traditionally, a provisional budget
covers only day-to-day mandatory expenses.
    The government also expects the budget to meet pressure
from trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic
demand, they said.
    The budget includes expenditures for a program to create
300,000 jobs and other reflationary measures, the officials
said.
    They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary
general Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials
yesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming
as possible.
    Economists said confidence of opposition members in their
campaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their
success in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could
lead to even further delays in passing the full budget.
    The result may be that the government will have to delay
its planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in
April, economists said.
    That package is expected to include a plan to carry out
more than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first
half of the fiscal year, a government official said.
    Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested
Nakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April

<TITLE>JAPAN EARTHQUAKE KILLS ONE, CUTS PHONE LINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, May 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A very strong earthquake that struck
southwest Japan killed one person and injured at least three,
cracked walls and cut telephone lines, authorities said.
    The quake, at 0336 GMT, registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, and officials issued warnings of tidal waves of up to
two metres high, they said.
    A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truck
overturned, and another was seriously hurt when his roof caved
in, police said. Two primary school children were hurt by
flying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom. The
extent of their injuries was not immediately known.
    A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki,
one of the worst hit areas, said walls cracked all over town.
    Weather officials told Reuters the quake's epicentre was 50
km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga, on
Kyushu's eastern coast.
    Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen along
the Kyushu coast to return to port, and dispatched a fleet of
six search boats to see them safely back.
    Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted and
all trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution,
police said.

<TITLE>LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said he was content with the current level of sterling and
welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in
British bank base lending rates to 10 pct.
    However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to
declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in
financial markets might push for big moves quickly.
    He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don't
think we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of
"gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy.
    Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates
were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled
yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the
key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of
GDP.
    Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made
this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were
"perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain.
    He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply
aggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to six
pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set
no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.
    Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),
Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter before
the next election."
    He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS
membership under constant review. But he would not indicate
what the chief considerations for this were for the government.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a
decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of
the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on
other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.
    Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current wave
of election fever" in Britain, he added:  "It is more likely that
there will be an election this year" than not.
    He said he supported an early election only because it
would clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have a
full term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawson
said.
    The government, which has been in power since 1979, must
call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either
a June or an early autumn election, political sources said.
    The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88
"was the right balance, economically and politically," he said.
    Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate
of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted
that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have
allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.
    But it was being praised today by political analysts as a
shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not
be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe
the electorate.
    Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much
the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion
stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.
    Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson
stressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) -
they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury had
no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.
    But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes in
the level of government borrowing, he added.
    Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively
high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in
Britain.
    He said conditions created by London's role as a leading
financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be
higher in real terms than in other countries.
    Three factors had caused the higher level in relative
interest rates in Britain, Lawson said.
    First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest
rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.
    He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused
by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.
     Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record of
low inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.
    Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent
financial centre, because it was more international in
character and more favourably placed in time zones than New
York or Tokyo.

<TITLE>DIXONS HAS 56 PCT OF CYCLOPS CORP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dixons Group Plc &lt;DXNS.L> said its
tender offer for all of the common shares in &lt;Cyclops Corp> of
the U.S. Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted
approximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each.
    This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares
on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned,
Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted
outstanding shares.
    The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all
the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common
stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25
dlrs each.
    Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the
fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17
this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over
the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L>.
    Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night's
close of 380p.
    On Friday, &lt;CYACQ Corp>, an investor group formed by
Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> and Citicorp &lt;CCI>, said it
would increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares
to 92.50 dlrs from 80.00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it
with confidential information given to Dixons and if it were
satisfied that any rights Dixon might have to recover fees or
expenses from Dixons or to buy Cyclops stock would be rescinded
or proved invalid.
    Audio/Video's offer is scheduled to expire March 20.

provisional budget, government officials said.
    Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's
plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system.
    The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over
Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it
impossible for the full 1987-88 budget to be passed by the
start of the fiscal year on April 1, government officials said.

    The planes "dealt accurate and effective blows to both
maritime targets before they returned safely to base," a
military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA.
    There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from
Persian Gulf shipping sources.
    The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8,
when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran's
Kharg island oil export terminal.
    Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship
had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile.
    They said there were no injuries on board and the ship
headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power
after the fire was put out.
    The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime
extension of the 6-1/2 year-old Iran-Iraq war.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's inflation and interest
rates should decline and the balance of payments improve
significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the
Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.
    The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue
that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic
product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct
drop forecast in December.
    Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in
the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.
    The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and
September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and
the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax
and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.
    The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to
change, it said.
    Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is
forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in
calendar 1986, it said.
    "Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for
reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are
also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of
payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls
away," the NZIER said.
    Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20
and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the
second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term
rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.
    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and
the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.
    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the
early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on
the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a
basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.
    "A marked improvement in the balance of payments is
forecast," the NZIER said. "The current account deficit is
expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in
1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88."
    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32
billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and
3.33 billion in 1985/86.
    The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion
dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87
billion in 1985/86.
    This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure
of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.
    "Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to
contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of
payments and the rate of inflation ...," the NZIER said.
    "Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand
economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well
for future prospects."

<TITLE>ICCO MEMBERS ACCEPT BUFFER STOCK PRINCIPLES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)
producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise
proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further
negotiation, delegates said.
    The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive
Director Kobena Erbynn, who wrote up the draft compromise, to
flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a
representative group of delegates, they said.
    The working group broke up for the day, into a smaller
group of five producers and five consumers to discuss
administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to
hammer out buffer stock rules details, delegates said.
    Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be
ironed out. "Whenever we start getting into details the clouds
gather," one delegate said.
    Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the
buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early
tomorrow, delegates said.
    The principles of the draft proposal included establishing
an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted
price system, a limit to the amount of non-ICCO member cocoa
that can be bought, and differentials to be paid for different
varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock, delegates said.

the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
shares.
    General Partners said it would set up voting trust
arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
broadcasting subsidiary.
    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
minority shareholders to elect directors.
    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
&lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
for 1.66 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
payments and political contributions.
    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television
station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los
Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would
also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
    For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs
on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.
    A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and
the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.

<TITLE>FRANCE PROTESTS OVER CANADA'S FISHING BAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>France today protested over Canada's
decision to declare its ports off limits to French fishing
vessels and bar further fishing by France off Newfoundland.
    A foreign ministry statement described yesterday's decision
by Canada as "unjustified and contrary to international law and
commitments made by Canada," and called on Ottawa authorities to
reexamin their position.
    Accusing the French of overfishing, Canada yesterday said
that any French fishermen caught in the Burgeo Bank area, off
the south coast of Newfoundland, would be arrested.
    "The French government strongly protests against the closing
of Canadian ports to French fishing vessels and against the
fishing ban decided by canada on the Burgeo Bank," the ministry
statement added.
    The French foreign ministry said the measure, the latest
episode in the long-running fishing dispute, would have a
negative effect on fishing negotiations currently held between
Ottawa and Paris.
    Canada is claiming the French have exceeded their
6,400-tonne quota of cod allowed in the area.
    In January Canada and France concluded an interim fishing
accord, opposed by fishermen in both countries, allowing France
to increase its cod quota by about 15,000 tonnes during 1987.
    Under this accord, Canada and France also agreed to refer
differences over a maritime boundary zone near the French
islands of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to international
arbitration.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Franz-Josef Ebel, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is likely to steer a
steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in
credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central
bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.
    "There is no need for action," Hermann Remsperger, chief
economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.
    Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last
month's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money
stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target
zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.
    One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf
two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only
indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.
    Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to
further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.
    But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to
stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade
deficit.
    Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also
precluded a further cut in official interest rates.
    Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5
pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.
    Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank
council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money
supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates.
But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.
    Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained
stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to
return to within the target range later this year.
    "The special factors which boosted money supply growth last
year are disappearing," one economist said.
    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986
was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.
    This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic
credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock
growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.
    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope
for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.
    Money market dealers said period rates remained little
changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.
    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95
yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.
    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on
behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But
rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect
of this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for
the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.
    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities
repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in
rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned
banks.
    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown
the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.
    One dealer said, "If the central bank wanted lower interest
rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down."
    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve
assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on
Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of
March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.

<TITLE>U.S. REAL GNP ROSE 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Gross National Product,
after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised
annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise
estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
    The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged
the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of
1986 over 1985.
    The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly
reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total
decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the
department said.
    The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending

<TITLE>JAPAN TELECOM MERGER COULD INVOLVE U.K.,U.S. FIRMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cable and Wireless PLC &lt;CAWL.L> and the
Pacific Telesis group &lt;PAC.N> may take part in a proposed
merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's
international telecommunications market, a senior industry
official said.
    Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with
the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a
news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums
agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to
participate in the new merged firm.
    The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only
one private company should enter the market.
    The two consortiums, &lt;International Digital Communications
Planning Inc> (IDC) and &lt;International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),
were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.
    Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the
size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign
investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.
    He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged
consortium at less than three pct and added that even the
largest shareholders could own only some five pct .
    Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh and
Co.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while
Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N> jointly
hold 13 pct .
    ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several
firms including Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;TOYO.T>  belong to both.
    Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger
agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the
government on having only one private consortium as two
companies might invest "excessive" amounts.
    He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue this
week.

<TITLE>FERRUZZI NEGOTIATING EUROPEAN ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> is in the
advanced stages of negotiations that could result in an
acquisition worth "some hundreds of billions of lire" in the
European agro-industrial sector, a company spokesman told
Reuters.
    The spokesman declined to identify the other party or
parties involved in talks, or whether a complete takeover was
under discussion, but said an Italian newspaper report that
Ferruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for
13 European cereal processing plants owned by the U.S. Group
CPC International Inc &lt;CPC.N> was incorrect.
    The spokesman said that possibility had been evaluated by
Ferruzzi but that the company's attention at the moment was
"decisively in another direction."
    The spokesman, responding to a report in the Italian
economic daily Il Sole-24 Ore that Ferruzzi was considering a
possible bid for the CPC plants, told Reuters his company hoped
to conclude the talks currently underway in a couple of months.
    The spokesman said that since the U.K. Government last
month blocked Ferruzzi's bid to acquire &lt;British Sugar Plc>,
the company had been looking at other investment opportunities.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE PROFITS ROSE 6.1 PCT IN 4TH QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Profits of U.S. corporations, after
tax liabilities, increased 8.3 billion dlrs, or 6.1 pct, in the
fourth quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 144.2
billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    The increase was the largest since the third quarter of
1983, when profits rose 11.4 pct and followed a 5.5 pct rise in
the third quarter of 1986.
    For the full year 1986, profits after tax were 2.5 billion
dlrs, or 1.9 pct, higher than in 1985 at a total of 133.9
billion dlrs, the department said.
    The department also estimated corporate profits to reflect
retroactive provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
    It said profits after tax fell 11.2 billion dlrs in the
fourth quarter after a decline of 10.3 billion dlrs in the
third quarter.
    Profits before taxes and from current production rose 2.8
pct to 310.4 billion dlrs after rising three pct in the third
quarter.
    Profits tax liability rose to 114.6 billion dlrs in the
final quarter last year from 104.4 billion dlrs in the third
quarter, the department said.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yeoh May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's state oil company Petronas
will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from
May 1, trade sources said.
    Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest
cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level.
    Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
10 pct production cutback until mid-1987.
    However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an
average 510,000 bpd in 1987.
    The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit
further production cutbacks, the sources said.
    Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl
this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said.
    Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
Indonesian and Chinese crude output.
    The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as
there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said.
    In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two
to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month
for sale through tender, the sources said.
    However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the
reduced scale of production, they said.

it plans to reduce operating expenses by decreasing hours of
operation and its workforce and selling some assets.

as small acquisitions.
    In the year to end-October, Rank reported a rise in pretax
profits to 164.1 mln stg from 136.0 mln previously.

delayed its annual meeting to June 22 from May 14 to allow its
board to review possible recapitalization options before the
meeting.
    CooperVision today reported first quarter net income of
64.6 mln dlrs, after a 175.2 mln dlr pretax gain from the sale
of its ophthalmic business to Johnson and Johnson &lt;JNJ> for 260
mln dlrs in cash and a 17.9 mln dlr posttax charge from a debt
repurchase.  Sales were 94.4 mln dlrs.  A year earlier it
earned 7,300,000 dlrs after a 120,000 dlr loss from
discontinued operations, on sales of 85.4 mln dlrs.
    The company said an aggressive program of investment
spending to maintain or increase market shares its its two core
businesses will accelerate sales growth this year but hold back
increases in operating income in the near future.
    CooperVision said "Furthermore, until the entire net cash
proceeds from the recent sales of several of our businesses are
employed to reduce indebtedness, make strategic acquisitions
and/or are otherwise employed in relation to a possible
recapitalization of the company, recovery of net income will be
held back by the loss, particularly of the tax income, of the
(ophthalmic) pharmaceutical business sold to Johnson and
Johnson."

said it has told Harper and Row Publishers Inc representatives
that it intends to withdraw its proposal to acquire Harper and
Row for 50 dlrs per share in cash if the parties have not made
satisfactory progress in discussions by the close of business
on March 30.
    Harcourt Brace said, "We do not wish to put undue pressure

shareholders, cannot allow an offer of such magnitude to lie on
the table too long."
    Harcourt said three of its senior officers and its
investment bankers met yesterday with investment bankers for
Harper and Row to discuss the Harcourt Brace offer.
    Harcourt Brace said it will only pursue the acquisition if
a mutually-satisfactory merger agreement can be negotiated.
    Last week, a group formed by Theodore Cross offered to
acquire Harper and Row for 34 dlrs per share.  The group held
about six pct of Harper and Row.
    In addition, New World Pictures Ltd &lt;NWP>, holder of 4.5
pct of Harper and Row, had offered to discuss a merger with
Harper and Row.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Davy McKee Ltd, a subsidiary of U.K.
Engineering and contruction company Davy Corp Plc, has been
awarded a contract worth around 15 mln stg for the design of a
zinc and lead smelter in India, a spokesman for the company
said.
    The contract is being funded by Britain's Overseas
Development Administration as part of a total grant of 73.65
mln stg to India's state-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd.
    The grant is for the development of a major zinc and lead
mine and associated smelting complex in Rajastan, North West
India, the agency said.
    The agency said the project was expected to account for 44
pct of India's total production of zinc.
    A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply
of goods and services from Britain. The grant comes as part of
package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development.
    The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India's
coal sector, for the expansion of its indigenous coal
development programme, using British-designed longwall
technology.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German commercial banks are
cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
usual interim period.
    A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting
leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>
and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank
fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
banks.
    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
economist at the German Banking Association said.
    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
them at higher yields in the future, he said.
    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
supply aggregate.
    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
expanded target range of three to six pct.
    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
beginning to decline.

aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
outstanding.
    The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
    In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
meet as soon as possible.
    In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and
a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
a unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
    A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was
meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He
said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
    He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
whether it would issue a statement later today.
    In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain
Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the
company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
tires and related products segment.
    The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
over license renewals at several of its television stations.
Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
    General Partners officials were not immediately available.
    Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
    The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr
credit line from Wells Fargo.
    Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,
the partnership said.
    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in
the tender offer, it said.
    In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it
could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.
    Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered
to acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but
withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler
eventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs.

estimated 4.7 billion baht in February from 2.1 billion in
January and 2.8 billion a year ago, the Bank of Thailand said.
    Exports fell to around 18.9 billion baht from 20.4 billion
in January compared with 17.4 billion a year ago, the bank
said.
    Imports rose to 23.6 billion baht from 22.5 billion in
January. They were 20.2 billion in February 1986.
    The bank said the trade deficit for the two months widened
to an estimated 6.8 billion baht from 5.2 billion a year ago.
    February's current account showed a 1.2 billion baht
deficit compared with 1.7 billion in January and 263 mln a year
ago.
    The current account for the two months posted an estimated
500 mln baht surplus, down from 1.2 billion a year ago.
    A surplus in the country's balance of payments narrowed to
3.2 billion baht in February from 4.6 billion the previous
month but was higher than 1.5 billion a year ago.
    The bank said the balance of payments surplus for the first
two months of 1987 widened to 7.8 billion baht from 4.6 billion
from the same period in 1986, while the net capital inflow rose
to five billion baht from 3.1 billion.

<TITLE>MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its
1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares
and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
elaborate.
    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
&lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
during the bid.
    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
affair.
    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
information. He currently faces criminal charges.
    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the
most traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff had
been supportive.
    "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet."
    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable
touch of the budget."
    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
new chief executive within a few months.
    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.
    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on
yesterday's 375p.

<TITLE>ENVOY SEES BRIGHT ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR PHILIPPINES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By PHILLIP MELCHIOR, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines is poised for several
years of stability and economic growth but faces major
long-term problems from its rapidly increasing population, U.S.
Ambassador Stephen Bosworth told Reuters in an interview.
    "Medium-term out to the 1990s I am increasingly optimistic
about this country," he said. "But if you look beyond that... You
are jumping off the edge into the unknown."
    Bosworth, who retires on April 2 after almost four years as
U.S. Ambassador, forecast a real per capita increase in
disposable income of more than four pct in 1987.
    The Philippines has not seen such an increase this decade.
    He said there were reasons to believe the Philippines could
out-perform the world economy by enough to continue to generate
increases in per capita income in the medium term.
    "There is nothing big and dramatic yet and maybe big and
dramatic won't ever happen. But I think foreign investors are
now no longer saying let's wait and see how the political side
turns out," he said.
    Bosworth said much hope had been placed on the land reform
program promised by President Corazon Aquino, but he warned it
was not a complete cure for the country's ills.
    He said even the redistribution of land to tenant farmers
would not be a substitute for the generation of new employment
in the countryside."There is no way even in 1987 that this
country can provide employment growth in farming. Certainly it
is not going to be able to do so in the future," he added.
    "This has to be off-farm employment," he declared.
    Bosworth said the population problem produced major
uncertainties for the future of the country. He said that more
than 60 pct of today's 50 mln people are said to live below the
poverty line and official predictions suggest the population
will double within the next three decades.
    The ambassador said he believed population statistics to be
understated.
    Bosworth said he expected current high domestic liquidity
to be drawn down during the next six months with some
corresponding upward pressure on interest rates, now at about
nine pct.
    He said his predictions only assumed the Aquino government
did not make any big mistakes. They did not assume any great
transformation of the Philippine system.

<TITLE>SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
action against Allegheny International Inc, the
Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
    Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
    "Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
proceeding against the company," Allegheny said.
    "The company is cooperating in the commission's
investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
of testimony of employes and others," Allegheny said.
    In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
for information about company executive compensation and
benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
    It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
divestitures, the company's accounting system "and other
internal controls," Allegheny said.
   The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
on its enforcement actions.
    The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
statements.
    The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
securities law violations involving numerous current and former
Allegheny officers and directors.
    Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
public shareholders at an unfair price.
    Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
against all charges.
    The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
    In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

its 1986 financial statements will receive an unqualified
opinion by the company's auditors, Authur Andersen and Co.
    The company said the qualified opinion on its 1985
financial statements will be changed to an unqualified opinion.
The 1985 opinion had been qualified due to the uncertainty of
the ultimate recoverability of the amount at which Publicker's
United Kingdom beverage division's assets are carried.
    The company said it has been in the process of
substantially reducing its inventory of Scotch Whisky and
currently intends to complete the reduction by the end of 1987.

<TITLE>VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned
subsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
year.
    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
amount from 1985's record levels.
    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
billion this year.
    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
would ensure VW got a share of profits.
    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
to 59,800 last year.
    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
out in 1987.
    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
in 1985.
    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
57,000.
    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
compared with 1985's 392,000.
    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to
further new hiring of employees.
    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record
39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had lent one
billion stg to the discount market for fourteen days at 10 pct.
    This brings the Banks total help today to some 1.34 billion
stg and satisfies the estimated shortage in the system today
which it had earlier estimated at 1.3 billion stg.
    The Bank's announcement this morning that it was willing to
lend two-week money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as
a sanction for lower U.K. Base lending rates.
    The U.K. Clearing banks swiftly took this up, cutting their
base rates by a half-point to 10 pct. At midday, the central
bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount.

<TITLE>CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jerry Bieszk, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Most of the cattle now being placed on
U.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on
feed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle
prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.
    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a
longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements
reported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock
analysts said.
    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in
seven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had
expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a
15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.
    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted
reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively
lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter
cattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the
summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally
placed on feed.
    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to
obtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge
that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.
    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,
helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from
February, 1986.
    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes
said, "The probabilities are high that in order to place that
many cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to
lighter-weight cattle.
    The only statistics available are from some terminal
markets which represent only a small percentage of the total
cattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs
in February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.
    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,
Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.
    If the average weight is down, and there is no price
weakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at
lighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as
three pct.
    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly
LBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly
because of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle
prices.
    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain
supplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle
prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from
wheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.
    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat
pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.
    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and
Graham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend
is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his
area benefited from a dry, mild winter.
    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and
some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less
than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.

<DATELINE>    New York, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New York cocoa traders reacted with
caution to today's developments at the International Cocoa
Organization talks in London, saying there is still time for
negotiations to break down.
    "I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short
at this point," said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading
firm Barretto Peat. "If and when a final position comes out (of
the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions.
The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible
gain."
    ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted
the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as
a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of
representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.
    "Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it
any stronger than that," Ward said.
    "It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...
but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate," said
another trader of today's developments.
    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations
and have remained so, traders said.
    "The dealers have got historically small positions in
outright terms," one trader said.
    Speculators have gone net long "but only slightly so," he
added.
    The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the
last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally
against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure
of origin selling, traders said.

<TITLE>REAGAN UPBEAT ABOUT LATEST GNP FIGURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the 1.1 pct
U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986
"wasn't all that bad."
    The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the
Gross National Product in the October-December period was only
slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1.3 pct made
earlier.
    At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP
price deflator, rose by 0.7 pct during the period.
    Asked his reaction to the GNP report during a White House
photo session, Reagan replied, "It wasn't all that bad."

said it expects its audited results for 1986's fourth quarter
to be lower than its previously estimated 10 to 15 cts per
share.
    Philip Crosby Jr, executive vice president, said normal
accounting adjustments, as well as a review of the company's
international operations due to a previously reported alleged
embezzlement, resulted in the lower results.
    Philip Crosby reported fourth quarter 1985 results of 1.3
mln dlrs, or 37 cts a share prior to an August 15 two-for-one
stock split.
    Crosby said, however, he expects the company to report
higher first quarter 1987 revenues than the 1986 first quarter
revenues of 11.8 mln dlrs.
    Crosby said that tuition levels from the management
consulting service company's courses this month are at the
highest level in the company's history.

privatise the state-owned bank Utvegsbanki, the country's
second largest. Parliament also granted an 800 mln crown cash
infusion to ease cash flow problems that arose when the bank
lost 600 mln crowns in a shipping firm bankruptcy two years
ago.
    Utvegsbanki director Halldor Gudbjarnarson told Reuters the
decision to privatise the bank was a relief and that foreign
banks had already expressed interest in taking a share.
    A quarter of the one billion crown total share capital will
be available to foreign investors, government officials said.

<TITLE>STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Silver looks "unlikely to break out of
gold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although this
year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than
supply, a study by Credit Suisse said.
    The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200
tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to
14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850
tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.
    The study noted that the effects of last year's lower
prices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which
was now back down to around levels of a decade ago.
    However, the study said that primary production, likely to
reach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in
1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.
    Around a third of silver production comes from heavily
indebted Mexico and Peru.
    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the
majority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

to DP-9 (middle BBB) from DP-8 (high BBB), preferred stock

    Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double
the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This
overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of
nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche
Babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital
when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend.

<TITLE>U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's modest half-point cut in U.K.
Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's
determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but
financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.
    They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2
pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed
a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.
    Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates
after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg
reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion
stg.
    Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key
three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start
of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied
to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.
    Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with
gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper
below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.
    But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have
placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates
recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling
and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.
    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and
the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors
was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt
prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.
    "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The
Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper
the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."
    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash
to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to
maintain the new rates for about that period of time.
    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how
sterling performs in the near term.
    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially
through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains
would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.
    "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the
time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David
Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold
up rates for long."
    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents
this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.
    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan
Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the
near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a
whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."
    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had
very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange
rate.
    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of
a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not
materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact
on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.
    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well
as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances
of re-election for the Conservative government and probably
advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.
Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this
was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated
assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial
targets.
    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour
because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's
Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town,
especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry
plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of
recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts
and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.
    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored
rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the
market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea
through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.
    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct
more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.
    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of
current capacity within two years through mergers and
regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month
and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.
    They said from September a semi-government body will assure
repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred
through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another
30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.
    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied
to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage
built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.
    The commission has held several hearings with the industry
and approval should be given this month, the sources said.
    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a
planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support
should help Japanese yards recover their international
competitiveness, they said.
    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of
building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a
maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)
in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.
    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most
yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.
    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for
1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to
3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.
    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to
30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between
1986 and 1989.
    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,
followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's
Register of Shipping.
    However, falling orders and declining international
competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in
the industry, the sources said.
    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding
companies reported current deficits in the first half of the
year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report
current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.
    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise
productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also
been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt
years, the sources said.
    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in
fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The
two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>
and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --
account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.
    "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out
the recession as their technology is the best in the world,"
said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.
    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,
has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,
and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.

reserves indirectly via 1.5 billion dlrs or more of customer
repurchase agreements, economists said.
    They said the below-six pct Federal funds rate suggests the

somewhat increased need to supply reserves.

<TITLE>BRISTOL-MYERS &lt;BMY> SEEKS AIDS VACCINE TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bristol-Myers Co &lt;BMY> said it would
seek Food and Drug Administration permission to test its AIDS
vaccine in humans by the end of March.
    A company spokesman said the company will file an
investigational new drug application by the end of the month,
requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.
    Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created an
AIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies to
the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists of
smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS
virus.
    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would
allow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would
have to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing
two AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid
virus is created that simulataneously immunizes against
smallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.
    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the
AIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins
and it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity
against AIDS.

<TITLE>SURALCO BAUXITE REFINERY REOPENED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1.4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite
refinery at Paranam in Surinam, which closed at the end of
January after being sabotaged by anti-government rebels, has
now reopened, a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton
said.
    The refinery is run by Suralco, jointly owned by the U.S.
Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton, which is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell.
    Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running
at around 3,000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to
full capacity of 4,000 tonnes within a week, the Billiton
spokesman added.
    The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when
rebels cut the main power line.
    Earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of
bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa's mine
at Moengo in the east of the country.
    Billiton's mine at Onverdacht, between Paranam and the
capital Paramaribo, is still working but Moengo remains closed
and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the
Billiton spokesman said.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp said if the
Brazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place its
medium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis.
    This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln
dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10
mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full
year, company officials told a press briefing.
    Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,
according to the annual report released at the briefing.
    In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a
declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a
moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium
and long term debt obligations.
    Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to
Ecuador, which total 25 mln dlrs. This would reduce 1987
pre-tax and after-tax net by 800,000 dlrs in the first quarter,
and by two mln dlrs for the full year, the bank-holding
company's officers said.

<TITLE>HANDY AND HARMAN SEES SUFFICIENT SILVER SUPPLIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>World stocks of silver are large
enough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation
this year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceed
mine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its
annual review of the silver market.
    The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew
20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply
deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and
production level of 382,000,000 ounces.
    However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000
ounces at the end of 1986, it said.
    The review noted that world industrial consumption has been
on an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pct
below the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.
    Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were used
to produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,
with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.
coins, including the American Eagle.
    It also said that in recent years Communist countries have
increased their silver imports and estimated that China and
East Germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silver
in the last five years.

<TITLE>SPANISH POWER COMPANY FECSA MAY SUSPEND PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jules Stewart, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's financially troubled power
company &lt;Fuerzas Electricas de Cataluna S.A.> (FECSA) may
suspend payments if it fails to reach agreement with creditors
on renegotiating its 594 billion peseta debt, a company
official said.
    "We would only take this step in the event of a lack of
co-operation on the part of our creditors," FECSA assistant
general manager Jose Zaforteza told Reuters in a telephone
interview. "It is unlikely they will refuse to renegotiate."
    He said creditors would obtain a better deal by negotiating
than under a suspension of payments.
    FECSA is scheduled to begin formal talks with its creditors
on April 6, and foreign banks holding some 184 billion pesetas
of debt said they were angered over what they called a lack of
information on the company's situation.
    The spokesman for one U.S. Bank creditor said in reply to
inquiries "It has been two months since we first detected signs
of serious trouble at FECSA, and we still have no idea of how
the company plans to restructure its finances."
    The spokesman said no foreign bankers had been notified
when FECSA yesterday, in an action unrelated to a possible
total payments suspension, suspended payment on its debt
principal.
    FECSA's Zaforteza said, however, that telexes had been sent
to creditors notifying them of the move, which he said was
unavoidable.
    He said the decision did not affect payment of interest on
loans and debentures. FECSA faces repayment of 60 billion
pesetas in interest and 30 billion on principal this year.
    The U.S. Bank spokesman said foreign banks "were now more in
the dark" than ever.
    FECSA called for renegotiating its debt when the Madrid
stock exchange on February 6 suspended trading in its shares, a
move which officials said was meant to protect shareholders.
    Zaforteza said the company will ask its creditors to switch
old debt to new loans at lower interest rates, postpone
interest payments and possibly convert some debt into shares.
    Foreign bankers said they assumed the government was
involved in the control and management of the electricity
sector.
    They added that lending policy toward the industry could be
affected if the banks lost money in FECSA.
    Foreign banking sources said they considered likely a fresh
postponement of a 10 billion peseta Chase Manhattan Bank
&lt;CMB.N> led syndicated loan to power company &lt;Hidrolectrica de
Cataluna S.A.> (Hidruna).
    The facility was scheduled to be signed in mid-February but
was postponed when the bourse suspended FECSA's shares.
    "We planned to sign this month but that looks unlikely under
the present circumstances," a foreign banker said.

<TITLE>GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance and economy ministers of the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks
after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at
boosting economic integration.
    But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a
resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.
    The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed
Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that
the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank
governors for further discussion.
    He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed
denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were
asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance
ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.
    Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to
discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new
system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit
conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.
    The denominator approved by the governors has not been made
public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC
citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state.
They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens
to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms.
    He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods
containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear
disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with
excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he believes the Reagan Administration will review its
decision to cut the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve because of a department report issued yesterday warning
of growing U.S. dependence on oil imports.
    "As part of this study, I think the Administration will
take the fill rate under review," Herrington said at a House
Energy subcommittee hearing.
    The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from
75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988
to save money.
    "My personal feeling is that is too low. I favor the
maximum fill rate (of 100,000 bpd)," Herrington said.

<TITLE>CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a
substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's
annual report says.
    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for
bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and
requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be
restored to current earnings status, it said.
    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal
taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.
    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "in
its entirety" in 1987.
    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation
rules, and although the impact will not be material in the
short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that
income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report
said.
    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by
17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.
    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8
mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in
1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it
said.
    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the
use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental
takes place, the report said.
    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next
two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.
    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior
convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in
the form of common stock.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Finance Committee
approved nonbinding resolutions urging the Reagan
administration oppose Canada's ruling on U.S corn imports and a
proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils.
    The resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent
to the Senate floor were they are expected to be approved.
    The EC oils measure, offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if
the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers.
    Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., offered the corn amendment
which urges the administration to file a complaint with the
GATT if the U.S. believes the corn decision by Canada was
unjustified. Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85
cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Stern, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the
Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing
the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf
export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.
    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the
cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a
dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than
normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making
it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.
    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA
could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,
where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the
government price support loan program and then marketed.
    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement
would break the Gulf corn basis.
    "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county
posted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking the
average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," which
would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior
Midwest.
    "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealer
said, which has created uncertainty in the market.
    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort
to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to
the government and remain off the market and in storage.
    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly
more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates
it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date
been exchanged for grain.
    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK
certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the
USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain
by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.
    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in
barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest
to the export terminals, cash dealers said.
    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen
nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the
original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of
the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the
firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.
    The higher transportation costs have served to depress
interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by
the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as
discouraging farmer marketings, they said.
    "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"
which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much
as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader
said.
    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,
freight rates will settle back down because of the overall
surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate and House investigators into
the Iran arms scandal agreed to grant limited immunity to
obtain the testimony of key witnesses and to combine their
planned hearings.
    Chairmen of the separate Senate and House select Iran
committees told a news conference they would accede to a
request from special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh and hold off for
90 days before hearing testimony from Oliver North and John
Poindexter, two former White House aides who played leading
roles in the secret arms deal.
    Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House committee, and Daniel
Inoyue, chairman of the Senate panel, also said they would "meld"
their separate investigations, a move that will speed up
congressional hearings into the affair.
    One member predicted Congress now would be able to finish
its work by Labor Day in early September.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST BERLIN, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The DIW economic research institute
said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach
the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.
    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national
product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in
real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
of last year. 
    The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the
remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and
production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to
1.5 pct.
    Other institutes and economists have recently revised their
forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.
    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that
the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand
healthy but foreign demand weak.
    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for
capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer
goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.
    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been
hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had
caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.
    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were
continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,
it said.
    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute
in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall
markedly this year.
    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change
from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further
improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared
with 1986, it said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House said a proposal for
a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review.
    Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had no
position on recommendations submitted by Energy Secretary John
Herrington to encourage investment in the hard hit domestic oil
industry.
    But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental
objection to tax rises and special tax breaks.
    He said that even though Herrington's recommendation did
not agree with existing policy, "We'll take a look at it."
    The review will be undertaken by the president's Domestic
Policy Council.
    Herrington's proposal was reported by the Washington Post
to have been made in a letter to Reagan submitting a study that
found the United States would be importing half of its oil by
the 1990s, threatening U.S. national security.

<TITLE>UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael
Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of
domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good
basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.
    The controversial study, which has not yet been released by
the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm
subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD
sources in Paris said last month.
    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,
suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing
domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade
negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.
    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do
not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.
    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for
the years 1979 through 1981.
    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a
negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community
would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions
taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters
they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.
    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave
technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.
U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study
including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect
recent changes in farm programs worldwide.
    The officials said the study may be released in May.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>An official of Boeing Co said the company
would not be handing out any "give-away" deals under its
commitment to provide business worth 4.4 billion francs to
French firms over eight years.
    The U.S. Aircraft maker agreed last month to grant
so-called "offset" contracts equivalent to 130 pct of the cost of
France's purchase of three AWACS radar early warning planes.
    "I would like to stress the need for competitiveness," said
Lee Hessler, Business Manager for Boeing Aerospace Co's

<TITLE>FRANCE ANNOUNCES PLAN TO BOOST EMPLOYMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government announced a three billion
franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation
among political and economic analysts that it is positioning
itself for a period of economic reflation.
    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe
Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc
contingency fund announced on February 25.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a
reflationary program.
    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for
more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third
of French unemployed, government figures show.
    The main measures of the employment program give employers
financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at
least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term
unemployed return to the labour market.
    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security
contributions are the main incentives for employers.
    "Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong
incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour
market and that's why the proposals...Are costly," an aide to
Seguin said.
    The analysts said speculation the government is considering
a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis
Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally
agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.
    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out
economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its
1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.
    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's
remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate
the economy through a boost to consumer spending although
government policy allowed for increased industrial investment
from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.
    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue
from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt
and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.
    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly
reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on
social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.
     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of
strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and
drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with
labour.
     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation
of Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas
&lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year
privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it
this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in
1988.
    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted
revenue to boost industrial and research investment and
spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway
network.
   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last
year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage
more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by
improving the competitiveness of French industry.
    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and
variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put
to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed
for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of
State.

<TITLE>ATT &lt;T> TO REDEEM 15.5 MLN PREFERRED SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph said
that, effective May 1, it will spend 775 mln dlrs to redeem 
15.5 mln shares of the outstanding 16.7 mln shares in two
publicly held preferred stock issues.
    The two issues have a stated value of 50 dlrs per share and
pay 3.64 dlrs and 3.74 dlrs in annual dividends, respectively,
ATT said, adding it will redeem 7.9 mln shares of its 3.64 dlrs
pfd stock and 7.6 mln shares of its 3.74 dlrs pfd stock.
    ATT's corporate vice president and treasurer S. Lawrence
Prendergast said ATT expects to finance the redemption with
cash.
    "The redemption is part of our continuing efforts to reduce
ATT's financial risk," Predergast said. "In 1986 we reduced our
outstanding debt and preferred stock by a total of 1.6 billion
dlrs. As a result our annual fixed charges were reduced by
almost 200 mln dlrs and our ability to service our existing
debt was strengthened."
    The May one preferred stock redemption will save about 50
mln dlrs in dividends annually and will bring ATT's total debt
and preferred stock reduction to more than 2.5 billion dlrs
since the beginning of 1986, Predergast said.
    ATT said it is required by the issues' terms to redeem
300,000 shares each year as well as providing for the optional
redemption of additional shares.
    The company said it will redeem 600,000 shares of the 3.64
dlrs preferred issue for 50 dlrs per share and 7.3 mln shares
of the issue for 50 dlrs per share plus a premium of 2.18 dlrs
per share.
    ATT said it will redeem each of the 3.74 dlrs preferred
shares 50 dlrs a share plus a premium of 2.35 dlrs a share.
    After the redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue will
remain outstanding, ATT said.
    ATT said it will select the redeemable shares by lot
according to the issues' terms, adding that the record date for
determining the redeemable shares will be March 26, 1987.
    The company said it will pay the May 1 dividend for all
preferred shares, including those being redeemed, in a normal
way to shareholders of record as of March 31, 1987.
    ATT said no transfer of the shares being called for
redemption will be made after March 26, 1987 and the transfer
books will close for those shares on that date.
    American Transtech Inc, the paying agent for the shares, 
will send notices of the redemption on March 30 to the
preferred shareholders who were selected by lot, ATT said.

<TITLE>U.S ENERGY SECRETARY PROPOSES OIL TAX INCENTIVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review."
    He said proposals, including an increase in the oil
depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,
should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at
the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.
    "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a year."
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995," Herrington said.
    He said it was too soon to say what the Administration
policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would
be opposition to tax changes.
    "Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options
would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the
tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been
favored by the administration. I think what we need is to
debate this within the Administration," he said.
    He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.
    Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's
Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging
an increase in the oil depletion allowance.
    Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington
said various proposals were under consideration and would be
debated within the Administration to determine which would have
the most benefits at the least cost.

<AUTHOR>    By Mohamed Elfatih Sidahmed, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KHARTOUM, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sudan will find it difficult to meet
scheduled debt repayments over the next five years, Finance
Minister Beshir Omer has told parliament..
    He said Sudan's foreign debt rose to 10.6 billion dlrs at
the end of last year, an increase of 300 mln from 1985.
    Omer said it "will be difficult, if not impossible" for Sudan
to pay a scheduled 4.17 billion dlrs in principal and interest
payments over the next five years.
    He said Sudan had reached agreement with the Soviet Union
and its East European allies to service half of its debts to
them in commodities, with the rest in hard currency.
    Western diplomatic and official sources in Khartoum say 32
pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is to the Soviet Union, the
Eastern bloc and Arab countries.
    Sudan is 450 to 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which last year declared it
ineligible for fresh loans.
    The sources said Sudan, hit by a slump in export earnings
and remittances from expatriate workers, had an annual debt
liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200
mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June
30.
    Sudan, its Treasury depleted by nearly four years of civil
war in the south and the aftermath of the devastating 1984-85
drought, has a budget deficit of 2.86 billion pounds this
fiscal year.
    Diplomatic and official sources said Sudan was now only
servicing debts owed to creditors bound by regulations banning
them from extending fresh loans to recipients in arrears.
    They said these included the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the World Bank and its soft loan affiliate, the
International Development Agency.
    Sudan reached a framework rescheduling agreement in 1984
with Western government creditors of the Paris Club.
    The sources said this pact was to have been followed by
bilateral agreements, but fell through when Khartoum became
unable to service debts in 1985.
    A Bank of Sudan (Central Bank) spokesman said last month
Khartoum was negotiating a freeze on interest payments with
commercial banks, owed about two billion dlrs.
    Sudan has not received fresh loans since 1985 and the
sources said it was only getting grants at present. Hopes that
foreign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr
budget deficit have been dashed, they added.
    Sudanese officials said Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi's
government would shortly announce a four-year economic plan
aimed at starting the country's recovery.
    Details of the plan have not been made public. But the
sources said it would be geared to generate agricultural
exports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans
that Sudan hoped to receive from Gulf Arab states.

said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach
the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.
    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national

real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
of last year.

<TITLE>MORRISON KNUDSEN &lt;MRN> SEES YEAR NET FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morrison Knudsen Corp said its
earnings for 1987 are likely to be lower than those for 1986
due to lower than expected growth in engineering and
construction and a previously-predicted decline in earnings of
its National Steel and Shipbuilding unit.
    The company earned 39.4 mln dlrs in 1986, including pretax
gains of 11.5 mln dlrs from pension income and 7,400,000 dlrs
from the settlement of vested pension obligations, down from
41.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
    It said "Lower than expected levels of new work booked in
the last quarter of 1986 and the first two-plus months of this
year have delayed the expected growth in the engineering and
construction area."  The company said it will remain profitable
in 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses. 
It attributed the decline in new work to more stringent bidding
standards and a competitive market.

<TITLE>MONEY BROKER SOUGHT IN VOLKSWAGEN CURRENCY SCANDAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUNSWICK, West Germany, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The state prosecutor
investigating a suspected currency swindle which may have lost
Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> millions of dollars said he wanted to
question a Frankfurt-based money broker.
    Prosecutor Carl Hermann Retemeyer told Reuters the broker,
Joachim Schmidt, may be able to shed light on the affair in
which VW says it might have been defrauded of up to 480 mln
marks.
    No charges have been laid in what may turn out to be West
Germany's largest known currency fraud.
    The incident has led to political calls for tighter
controls on the free-wheeling money and currency markets.
    Retemeyer gave no further details of the investigation. His
office understood that Schmidt was on a business trip.
    A spokesman for the brokerage firm told Reuters that
Schmidt had been expected back on Monday from the United States
but had not returned yet, and his current whereabouts were not
known.
    Brokerage firms fulfill a middle-man function in currency
and money markets, matching buy and sell orders between banks
and other large customers who may prefer to remain anonymous.
    The financial newsletter, Platow, said today the state
prosecutor, called in when suspicion of fraud first came to
light on February 18, had to date been able to find no evidence
of personal enrichment by VW employees.
    The newsletter reported on November 3 last year that VW had
incurred losses in the "three-figure millions" because it had not
protected itself against a fall in the value of the dollar.
    This was denied at the time by VW executive board chairman
Carl Hahn.
    Financial director Rolf Selowsky resigned last week after
news of the currency fraud, an executive has been fired and
several others are suspended.
    A Frankfurt business lawyer, Egon Geis, said yesterday that
on February 10 he had offered VW information about the currency
fraud and offered to provide a written confession by someone
involved.
    He said VW declined his offer, but the company says the tip
was taken to top management and that Geis later met Hahn but
failed to produce the document.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PLAN SEEKS TO BAR FOREIGN TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A House subcommittee voted to give
President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies similar to the takeover of Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB>
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp by Fujitsu Ltd which was
withdrawn.
    The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce
approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a
provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign
companies if the sale was not in the national or economic
interest.                
    The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and
Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall
trade bill which is being written by several House committees.
    The subcommittee's bill would bar imports of digital audio
recording equipment that is not made with anti-copying chips.
This provision is designed to protect U.S. companies from the
unauthorized use of U.S. designs in foreign products.
    The bill calls for an investigation of whether U.S.
engineering and construction firms are given adequate
opportunity to bid on Japan's civil works procurement practices
including the construction of the Kansai airport.
    The Energy and Commerce subcommitte rejected a plan offered
by Rep. William Dannemeyer, a California Republican, to require
the U.S. to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their
gold investments in government storage.
    His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins
and gold-backed bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to
investors to reduce the federal debt.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan, reacting to
Canadian concerns, today announced he will seek 2.5 billion
dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.
    The announcement said the administration will request from
Congress 500 mln dlrs in each of the next two fiscal years to
fund innovative projects to control smokestack emissions --
blamed for acid rain that has killed fish and trees in eastern
Canada.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration had asked for 350 mln dlrs but that Ottawa had
registered concern about the level of funding.
    He said the announcement was "obviously related" to an
April-5-6 summit meeting in Ottawa between Reagan and Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Reagan said that in addition to committing government money
industry would be encouraged to invest a greatwer or equal
amount to promote new technologies to cut air pollution.
    The announcement said an advisory panel, including state
governmments and the canadian government, would advise on
funding and selection of polllution control projects.
    Further, a presidential task force on regulatory relief
would examine the effect of federal, state and local
regulations on deployment of new emission control technologies.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Commission said it could
begin legal moves within the next month against three major
airlines - Deutsche Lufthansa AG &lt;LHAG.F>, Alitalia Linee Aeree
Italiane Spa &lt;AZPI.MI> and &lt;Olympic Airways> - accusing them of
unfair fare-fixing and route sharing practices.
    The Commission also announced a move designed to put
pressure on EC ministers to agree by the end of June a new,
more liberal, airline regime, which could bring lower fares and
a greater choice of carriers for passengers.
    The Commission has for years been pushing to force EC
airlines to abandon arrangements under which they agree not to
compete against each other on price and share flights on routes
between major cities on a 50-50 basis.
    Last July, it wrote to 10 major airlines saying their
practices breach EC competition rules and demanding
undertakings that they would be revised or abolished.
    The Commission said in a statement today seven airlines
have responded positively to these letters and negotiations are
taking place on how their practices might be modified.

<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia has cleared its arrears to the
IMF for 1985 with a 145 mln dlr bridging loan from Standard
Chartered Bank, central bank president Leonard Chivuno said.
    The government had obtained a further loan of 45 mln dlr
from the Bank of Credit and Commerce to help pay off its
remaining 165 mln SDR arrears for 1986 and is currently
negotiating loans from two other banks to complete payment, he
told a press conference .
    To restrict liquidity all commercial banks will have to
make a supplementary deposit with the Bank of Zambia,
equivalent to 10 pct of their demand deposits, Chivanu added.
    Following the IMF talks, the fixed exchange rate will be
adjusted against a basket of five major currencies, but it will
not fall below 12.50 kwacha per dollar, Chivuno said.
    He was speaking after three weeks' discussions with the IMF
centred on the revision of the exchange system.
    Diplomatic sources said the talks had gone well and a
Zambian delegation would leave for Washington in about three
weeks to complete negotiations with the IMF and World Bank on a
revised economic adjustment programme.
    One western diplomat said the two institutions had promised
"big support to help Zambia keep its head above water."

<AUTHOR>    BY JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling
last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas
bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next
winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts
said.
    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that
is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could
more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by
1990, some analysts said.
    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities
and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of
activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of
the nation's largest gas reserves are located.
    "We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent," said
James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "Many
companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling
because they're betting that the gas market will be back in
balance in a year or two."
    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news
for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely
survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a
barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a
return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig
count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield
roustabouts commanded premium wages.
    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a
barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs
active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.
    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but
dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil
prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.
    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said "In 1986, the United
States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that
replacement rate won't be any better this year."
    He added, "We don't have the options we do with oil.
Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and
importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible
in the next 10 years because of the cost."
    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves
were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16
trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.
    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co
agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a
new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.
    "We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to
dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990
supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later
than mid-1988," Gaspar said.
    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that
could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count
to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.
    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be
conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where
federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the
government unless drilling begins in the next two or three
years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon
Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have
already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later
this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.
    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will
spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest
production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of
gas per day.
    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and
Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in
recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is
on the verge of a recovery.
    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below
600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.
    "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets
above 30 dlrs a barrel," said Pickens, 58, adding he did not
expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.
    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,
is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.
    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect
significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s
when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about
seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50
dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three
dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.

<TITLE>SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin American sugar producers
are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving
to boost production, official and trade sources said.
    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.
Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the
region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.
    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the
alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin
American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),
told Reuters.
    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven
cents to stimulate notable increases in output.
    "Producers are taking measures for increasing their
production when the prices are profitable," he said.
    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued
rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders
in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.
    "The prices are ridiculous," said Julian Mateo, vice
president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural
League. "At current prices nobody is going to consider
increasing production."
    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing
output, given the instability of world markets.
    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar
Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.
"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet
giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify
anything."
    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are
available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln
tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A
year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000
more, according to the London-based International Sugar
Organization.
    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar
industry in many countries in the region into a recession from
which it will be hard to recover.
    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's
National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost
production even if prices recovered sharply.
    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from
900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport
and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short
term recovery in output, he added.
    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar
exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end
of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is
running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.
    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems
and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,
since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries
under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its
troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in
1985.
    The low world prices of recent years have led many
countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels
where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean
countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which
they receive prices well above free market levels.
    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to
production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to
the free world market.
    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In
both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year
its quota is only 37,000.
    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world
market levels continue at around half of Peru's production
cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.
    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials
stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane
which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo
Latorre, "grows like a weed" throughout the region.
    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240
mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in
excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into
sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.
    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol
Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from
foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.
    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the
past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant
Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in
1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to
next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point
being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of
sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would
cost eight cents to replace.
    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export
sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with
the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of
either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild
depleted reserve stockpiles.
    However, the situation could change dramatically if the
economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.
    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little
hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability
unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.
    "The agricultural policies of the European Community and of
the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm
by closing their markets, by price deterioration in
international commerce and furthermore by the unfair
competition in third countries," Brazil's Trade and Industry
Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA
meeting.
    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for
what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess
output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the
main cause of low prices.
    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which
would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the
region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement
would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised
countries would have to see it as a political rather than a
merely economic pact.
    "They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,
the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the
region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt," GEPLACEA's Latorre
said.

<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York
plans an issue of 12,000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs
an ounce, lead manager Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG said.
    Each warrant, priced at 955 Swiss francs, entitled holders
to acquire five-ounce bars of .999 gold in the period from
April 30, 1987, to July 31, 1991, exercisable on Wednesdays.
    The warrants represented unsecured, unsubordinated
liabilities of the borrower. Payment was due April 16, and a
quotation on the Luxembourg bourse was planned.
    The warrants, when exercised, would be repaid in current
dollars based on the value of gold on the exercise date.
    The conditions represent a premium of about 145 dlrs an
ounce to the current gold price.
    A Morgan (Switzerland) official said that on the basis of
the maturity of four years and three months, the pricing
involved an implicit volatility of gold of 24.5 pct before the
warrants were in the money, compared with implicit volatility
of 30 pct for the Indosuez gold warrants and 26 pct for the
Citibank gold warrants recent issued with maturities of 18 and
24 months.

<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender
offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
enough to buy the company, analysts said.
    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
    "The expectation is either there will be someone else or
the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
cooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
group.
    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
and political contributions.
    "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"
said Baker of the offer.
    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
for any transaction.
    A source close to General Partners, however, said General
Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
transaction to be carried out.
    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partners
would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
the stations.
    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
group that challenged the station's license.
    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
related products segment.
    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
share, he said.
    The company, formerly known as General Tire
and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
said.
    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
with the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.
    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
They said it would be possible the company might consider a
leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at
a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing

its will receive an unqualified opinion on 1986 financial
statements from auditor Arthur Andersen and Co and the opinion
on its 1985 statements will be changed to unqualified from
qualified.
    The company said the 1985 opinion had been qualified due to
the uncertainty of the ultimate amount recoverable from the
assets of its British beverage division.  It said it has been
in the process of substantially reducing its inventory of
Scotch whisky and intends to complete the reduction by the end
of 1987.  It said it expects to recover its 12 mln dlr
investment in the division by the end of the year.

countries, which agreed on the bases of a new International

<TITLE>NORSTAR &lt;NOR>, FLEET &lt;FLT> OUTLINE MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fleet Financial Group said
that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
    Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
announced April one Fleet stock split.
     The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
    Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
interstate banking law takes effect.
    For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
     Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
for either company's stock holders, the company said.
    For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
dlrs a share.
    In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
fully diluted shares outstanding.
    The transaction is subject to both regulatory and
shareholder approval.
    The companies said that after the proposed merger, the
combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the
country.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> UP ON SHEARSON RUMORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co climbed 2-1/2 to
80-1/8 on rumors the company was about to announce an agreement
to sell 10 pct of its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit to Nippon
bLife Insurance of Japan, traders said.
    Speculation about an impending deal, rumored to be worth
600 mln dlrs, also sent shares of other U.S. brokerages up
sharply. PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> gained 1-5/8 to 37-1/8 and
Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER> rose 1-3/8 to 42-7/8.
    American Express officials declined comment but cited a
statement it released more than two weeks ago in which it said
it was studying matters of strategic importance.
    American Express officials also pointed out the earlier
statement, issued March one, said it is company policy not to
comment on rumors or speculation. The earlier announcement also
said American Express and Shearson were studying options
including expansion of capacity to meet international
competition and broadening access to capital.
    The latest rumors originated in Tokyo, traders said.
    If the rumors are true "it gives them a nice infusion of
capital for an attractive price," said Lawrence Eckenfelder,
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.

<TITLE>CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>
Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to
reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six
months.
    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of
interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is
expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks
are under way.
    "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,
for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's
debt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.
    "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just
how long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said.
    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium
may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs
and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first
quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.
    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these
loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,
Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an
inquiry.
    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net
income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.
    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for
1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.
Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing
office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.
    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a
share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.
    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and
other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,
during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the
1984 restructuring agreement with the government.
    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it
is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,
Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss
rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.
    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market
rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.
    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank
would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it
bought three small suburban banks.
    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be
taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large
enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are
prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.
    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who
will eventually own the firm because it still holds the
equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.
    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has
said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The
agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984
bailout of the bank.
    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the
struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry
executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he
agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not
comment on a successor.
    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options
clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its
doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country
doesn't need external sources of cash.

<TITLE>EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) has
warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
trading partners.
    The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
    A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
    Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
    But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
    He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
then the United States would be in violation of its
international legal obligations and on a collision course with
its major trading partners."
    Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
enforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, any
administration must take its decision in light of the overall
national interest."
    Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction by
trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
imports from the United States."
    Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
    Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
    "Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
alone on the world trading system," he said.
    House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
    There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

<TITLE>FAIRCHILD PRESIDENT SEEKING MANAGEMENT BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fairchild Semiconductor Corp
president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management
buyout proposal to the company's parent at some point in the
future and substantial funding is available for such a
purchase.
    Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>.
    Brooks also told a press conference that if management is
successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.
    "I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur,
and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the
avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,"
Brooks said.
    Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an
exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu
Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.
    Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of
Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government
officials expressed opposition to the transaction.
    Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be
in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.
    He also said the transaction could be financed through a
debt issue or conventional financing from investors.
    Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment
proposals bought to them, but he added, "the investors must be
willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not
just selling off assets."
    Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct
intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.
    "I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington
and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist," Brooks
said.
    He also said Fujitsu executives remain enthusiastic about a
link with Fairchild.

<TITLE>HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 1988 agriculture budget will
have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
budget, Glickman added.
    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
    "The administration's target price proposals are dead in
the water," he said.
    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on the
table," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
will study in order to cut farm spending.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')
certificates will also be another option his committee will
study, Glickman said.
    While not committing himself for or against such action, he
said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
not be in favor of such a change.
    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
this program while making cuts in other areas.
    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
block," Glickman said.

<TITLE>CPC &lt;CPC> SEES 1987 HIGHER EARNINGS PER SHARE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>CPC International Inc said it expects
1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels.
    "We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per
share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,"
the company said in its 1986 annual report.
    In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,
on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142
mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in
January.
    A share buyback program started last year reduced the
number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from
97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.
    The food and grocery products company also said it was the
subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,
filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New
Jersey.
    The suits are related to the company's purchase of its
shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block
of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7
mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.
    The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an
artificially inflated price, violating securities laws,
breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate
assets.
    CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its
directors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of
improper conduct and are defending the suits.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By PETER ELSWORTH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     DALLAS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. oil and gas industry is in
better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony
given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of
the industry hearing today.
     The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas
industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company
executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry
downturn had bottomed out.
     "The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal
more optimistic (than last year)," Commissioner James E. (Jim)
Nugent told Reuters.
     "It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are
seeing the bottom of the economic cycle," he added, "and with
just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move
again."
     The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil
prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to
as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to
around 18 dlrs a barrel.
     At the same time, a number of company executives testified
that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment
was still hurting and in need of government help.
     Production costs are considerably higher in the United
States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell
many domestic producers were forced to shut down their
operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs
operating in the United States compared with an average of
nearly 2,000 in 1985.
     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of
Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil
coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing
dependency on imports, particularly from the politically
volatile Middle East.
     "In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower
prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day
(bpd)," said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply
Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oil
company.
     At the same time, Simon said "U.S. oil production declined
by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years," and "net
petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd."
     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain
between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to
control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at
1986 levels, leading to "a significant amount of spare
worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd."
     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued
volatility and called for "governmental and regulatory policies
in support of the domestic petroleum industry."
     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal
government through the 1986 tax code changes and "Superfund"
legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall
profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access
to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.
     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the
industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's
domestic operations before imports reach such a level that
national security might be compromised.
     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports
could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that
Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the
free world's total oil consumption by that date.
     Arguing that "oil is a political tool in every nation on
earth," Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called
for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, "before
the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and
our national security is compromised."
     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,
agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that
were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a
"shambles."
     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.
"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is
over," he said.
     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining
and Marketing Co, said he was "enthusiastic about the future,"
adding that he expected "an increase in profitability by
midyear."

it reached agreement in principle with its long term lenders

    When the agreements are finalized, Bralorne's debt

    During that period, principal payments will be deferred, if
necessary, and interest will be capitalized on a portion of the
long term debt, it said.
    Bralorne said it expects these agreements will enable the
company to operate within its cash flows and provide a stable
financial environment until the energy industry recovers.

<TITLE>CAROLINA POWER &lt;CPL> CANCELS GENERATING UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RALEIGH, N.C., March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carolina Power and Light Co said
its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
1992.
    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
review because of a decision by the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission that would have required
the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
scrubbers.
    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
through the use of low-sulphur coal, and "The addition of
scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
air quality improvements."
    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking
purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
development of a generating unit.
    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "The
higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with
scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."
    A company spokesman said the company has already spent
about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been
made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does
not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
it will make late this year or early next year.

<TITLE>NE ELECTRIC &lt;NES> AUDITORS QUALIFY ANNUAL REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New England Electric System's auditors
have again qualified the utility's annual report because of
uncertainty about whether its oil and gas subsidiary can
recover its investments.
    The qualification was noted in the annual report which New
England Electric released at a security analysts meeting today.
The auditors also qualified the company's 1985 report for the
same reason, noting the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in
early 1986.
    President Samuel Huntington told analysts the utility will
have to take a write-down of about 235 mln dlrs if Federal
regulators do not allow the company to pass on the losses cited
by the accountants to its rate payers.

<TITLE>NE ELECTRIC SEES HIGHER CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New England Electric System &lt;NES>
expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs
this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in
material distributed at an analysts meeting.
    It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in
1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.
    The utility said these totals exclude spending on New
England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity
from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this
venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.
    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln
dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission
lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.
    New England Electric said internally generated funds will
cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and
65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan
to spend in 1987.
    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on
its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally
generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.
    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs
worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional
higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit
plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year
as well.
    The company said it does not plan to offer common shares
this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise
about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its
dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.
    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the
construction spending projection is based on the expectation
that demand for electricity in the New England electric system
will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.
    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for
sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2
pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.
    He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices
and a strong New England economy.
    Huntington said New England Elecetric has "all but rejected
new coal fired plants" to supply additional power.
    He said the most attractive new power supplies are those
with short lead times which can be built in modules.
    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is
looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply
most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired
fluidized bed units.
    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in
modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the
traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of Wheat
Growers, NAWG, board of directors is scheduled to meet
Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State
Allen Wallis to discuss the Department's current role in farm
trade policy, the association said.
    NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the
organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the
importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the
degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State
Department trade policies to remain profitable.
    "Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have
in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product
to overseas markets," he said.
    Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next
month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG
"wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns
regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union."
    The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held
in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country
to meet with their state congressional delegations and members
of the executive branch.
    The purpose is to discuss the current situation for
producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and
regulatory agenda for the coming year, the NAWG statement said.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>World food production over the next decade
will exceed population growth, but because of unequal
distribution, many parts of the world will go hungry, the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said.
    In a report to be considered by its agriculture committee
at a meeting later this month, FAO said: "The long term trends
point towards a further polarisation of the world food system.
    "Some regions and commodities will continue to be troubled
by chronic surpluses that cannot find outlets...Some of the
poorer countries and regions will still be faced by the
combined problem of low nutritional levels, rapidly rising
populations, inadequate growth in both food production and
incomes...," FAO said.
    FAO set out several long-term goals to be considered by the
committee, which meets between March 23 and April 1.
    These included improving the international trading
environment for agricutural commodities, reducing food
surpluses in developed countries, conserving natural resources
and speeding up the increase of food production in developing
countries.

said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review."
    "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day," he said.
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995," Herrington said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION &lt;LDMFA> SEES BETTER YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Montreal, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said
earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase
by "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growth
experienced in the last four years.
    Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
president Michael de Groote told analysts.
    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
    De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results"
in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
specific.
    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
include possible further acquisitions and said that the
addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
through fiscal 1990.
    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
rest came from acquisitions, he said.
    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.
    He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing
negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
waste business through GSX Corp.
    "We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
management," de Groote said.
    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.
    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in
cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.
    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will
represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will
contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.
    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing
well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.
    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to
earnings per share for the year. He also said that further
acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely
within the next few months.

<TITLE>MEXICAN HYDROCARBON RESERVES FALL SLIGHTLY IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Mexico city, march 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>mexico's proven reserves of liquid
hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down
from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the
state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.
    Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose
sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72
billion in both 1981 and 1982.
    In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in
1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985.
Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.
    The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was
crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct.
    Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per
day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985.
    Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from
25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production,
were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the
offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of
production.

approved legislation to limit the interest rates charged by
banks and other credit card issuers.
    The Consumer Affairs and Coinage subcommittee bill would

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Problems in the farmbelt and
oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall
income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.
    The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8
billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1
billion dlrs.
    The total was still the second highest ever reported, but
it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.
    The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
    In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
    Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
it planned to issue.
    "I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
distinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidman
told reporters.
    He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
with regional differences in economic performance.
    Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
the pace would continue. 
    On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
number of new problem banks in all regions except the
Southwest, Seidman said.
    Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
year ago.
    Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
said.
    Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
    He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
expected.
    But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
Seidman said.

1987 first quarter earnings will be significantly lower than
fully diluted earnings of 22-1/2 cts per share in last year's

    The company said pricing competition and lower traffic

results.
    However, the company said its furniture and tire operations
are more profitable this year than last year.
    Arkansas Best also said that if the industry sustains the
upcoming 2.9 pct motor carrier rate hike it will offset the

    It said the labor increase then will be 3.2 pct for ABF

give President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of
U.S. companies similar to the takeover of Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. by Fujitsu Ltd which was withdrawn.
    The Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce approved
as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a provision
giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign companies if
the sale was not in the national or economic interest.
    The subcommittee rejected a proposal requiring the U.S. to
pay investors one pct for the right to hold their gold
investments in government storage. His amendment called for the
government to sell gold coins and gold-backed bonds with
maturities of 30 to 50 years to investors to reduce the federal

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>ESSO SAF &lt;ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary
of Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shut
down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.
Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French
refinery.
    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that
depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability
to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur
Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment
over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.
    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity
of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the
spokesman added.
    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would
be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port
Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a
petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.
    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that
Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might
decide to close one of its French refineries.

<TITLE>U.S. AGENCY FINDS RAILROAD REVENUES INADEQUATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service,
concluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroads
had adequate revenues in 1985.
    The finding is important because it means the ICC is likely
to look favorably on requests for rate increases by these
railroads made during the current year.
    Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny to
rate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.
    Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated by
the government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rate
if it finds it to be unreasonable.
    In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC
has been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry
and shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of
five commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.
    "For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns
have fallen well short of their cost of capital, however
defined," commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted
with the majority.
    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the
highest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and
Ohio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3
pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and
the Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.
    Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, the
Delaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the
Western Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found.

<TITLE>LATIN AMERICA SEEKS NEW APPROACH TO DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     San jose, march 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 25-nation Latin American Economic
System (SELA) has presented a document calling for a new
strategy to cope with Latin America's crushing debt and
faltering growth.
    SELA presented the document to a week-long conference of
latin american financial and economic experts, meeting to lay
the groundwork for this year's annual meeting of the united
nations conference on trade and development (unctad).
    SELA called for new efforts to break "the vicious circle of
debt, stagnation and productive retrogression the region has
been immersed in since the beginning of the decade."
    The alterantives to existing approaches for dealing with
the region's crushing foreign debt must include greater
concessions from creditors, according to sela.
    Radical concessions such as debt writedowns and schemes to
tie payments to real income must all be considered, the sela
document stresses.
    It notes that other favorable strategies include foreign
investment/debt equity swaps, already successfully experimented
with in some countries.
    Other policies recommended include more realistic exhange
rates and more producive capital investment programs.
    The sela document is expected to be approved by delegates
from all 26 latin american and caribbean nations meeting here
until friday.
    It will be submitted again for approval by developing
nations belonging to the so-called group of 77 scheduled to
meet next month in havana, cuba.
    At the havana meeting delegates from latin america, asia
and africa will attempt to hammer out a common position for
presentation at unctad's annal meeting next july in geneva.

<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emhart Corp said it plans to increase
worldwide revenues and earnings at an annual compounded growth
rate of 15 pct and about 13 pct, respectively.
    It said these objectives were based on several assumptions,
including a four pct average inflation rate through 1989 and a
two pct to three pct GNP real growth.
    In 1986, Emhart reported a net loss of 10 mln dlrs or 35
cts a share, after a 90 mln after-tax restructuring charge,
which realigned the company's assets.
    Emhart has divested itself of many of its units to focus on
three primary markets--industrial products, consumer products,
and information and electronic systems.
    Emhart said industrial products should account for about 62
pct of projected 1987 revenues of 2.3 billion dlrs, while
consumer products should account for about 20 pct of those
revenues and information and electronic systems about 18 pct.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian red meat production in
1986 fell more than 20 pct to 1.9 mln tonnes due to drought
which reduced slaughter weight and to herd rebuilding which
started because of high cattle prices, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    In its report on World Production and Trade Developments,
USDA said that in 1987, beef production is expected to reach
2.3 mln tonnes.
    Pork production in 1986 rose 83 pct to 1.1 mln tonnes due
to the sharp rise in beef prices and is expected to remain at
that level this year, USDA said.

<TITLE>HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc> said that,
due to poor market conditions for railway freight car
manufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in
Trenton, Nova Scotia.
    Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln
dlrs for the proposed sale.
    It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower
earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel
castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector
and improvements in forestry equipment.
    Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment
was limited with export sales frequently restrained by
customers' financing difficulties.
    Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways
continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at
the lowest level in the past decade.
    However, there was demand for industrial casting due to
increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.
    The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and
tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the
U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.
    The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in
aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of
engine components.
    Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a
strike in British Columbia and the extended debate on U.S.
imports of Canadian lumber, but there were encouraging signs at
yearend, the company said.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> GROUP TO SEEK ANTI-GREENMAIL VOTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAMCO Investors Inc, an affiliate of
Gabelli and Co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at
the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCO
Chairman Mario Gabelli.
    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a
premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today
received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8
pct of its stock.
    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp
stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.
    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was
reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive
investors to show holdings of more than five pct.
    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender
offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and
20 dlrs per share too low.
    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.
    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider
spinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast
properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast
properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.
    "One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to
the meeting and putting up "no greenmail," Gabelli said.
    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation
in the offer.
    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.

<TITLE>LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG
[OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a
moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln
schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard
Wagner said.
    Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct
rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to
greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling
interest rates.
    The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend
to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital
from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.
    Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour
to maintain the higher dividend in 1987."
    Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7
billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign
currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.
    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is
effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped
some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.
    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said
that it came close to one mln stg.
    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct
to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.
    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to
lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.
Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

    "We are asking our shareholders to postpone any decision on
whether to accept or reject the offer until the board finishes
its evaluation," Reynolds said in a statement.
    "The Wagner and Brown-AFG offer does not expire until April
14, so shareholders have time to make their decision," he said.

<TITLE>TRIPLE WITCHING ISSUE OVERHANGS FUTURES MEETING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Nelson Graves, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOCA RATON, Florida, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaders of the major U.S.
commodity exchanges and their federal regulators begin a
three-day meeting here tomorrow satisfied with the industry's
growth but uncertain about their futures.
    An estimated 1,200 industry officials are expected to
attend the annual gathering hosted by the Futures Industry
Association, FIA.
    The satisfaction comes from the dramatic expansion of the
U.S. futures and options industries over the last decade.
    The uncertainty surrounding this year's meeting stems
largely from a pervasive sense that the potential for major
market disruption stalks the futures, options and equity
industries.
    This bucolic resort will provide an ironic backdrop as the
financial industry's chiefs anxiously observe this quarter's
triple witching hour, March 20, when price gyrations threaten
to rock markets.
    Triple witching occurs when stock index futures and options
and individual stock options expire simultaneously.
    The quarterly phenomenon has been marked by price
volatility as arbitrageurs have shifted investments between
stocks and their derivative instruments.
    In an effort to quell price fluctuations, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, CME, home of the Standard and Poor's 500
stock index futures contract, recently announced plans to move
the contract's settlement to the morning of the quarterly
expiration day from the afternoon.
    The New York Stock Exchange this Friday intends to
implement stricter procedures requiring members to submit all
market-on-close orders in 50 blue-chip stocks by 1530 EST.
    Despite these efforts to ensure smoother contract
expirations, there is a sense more might have to be done to
avert an uncontrollable fall in prices someday.
    Looming over the exchanges are the twin threats of
fortified federal regulation and congressional action to strap
market activity.
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Susan
Phillips has said the current regulatory structure is adequate
to cope with intermarket arbitrage, but that she expects new
surveillance procedures and enhanced cooperation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.
    SEC Chairman John Shad, voicing concern over price
volatility associated with program trading, has resurrected a
proposal, opposed by CFTC officials, to give federal regulators
control over the setting of futures margins.
    Some contend that because futures margins are low relative
to stock margins, portfolio managers have a tendency to shift
out of stock index futures in a falling stock market, hastening
a downward price spiral.
    Absent from this week's meeting will be a key congressional
player -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee
responsible for overseeing the SEC.
    Dingell has promised to look into program trading and
explore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market
disruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual
trading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for
their own account before placing customers' orders.
    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the
perception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the
practice. The CME board responded with a plan that would
restrict, but not ban, the activity.
    The meeting will also be attended by regulators from
Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and
Singapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC
proposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign
futures and options on U.S. exchanges.
    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the
grounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.
    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the
exchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement
strict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to
revise federal limits on speculative positions and the
definition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which new
instruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.

<TITLE>CANADA WELCOMES LATEST REAGAN ACID RAIN PLEDGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government welcomed
President Reagan's announcement that he would seek 2.5 billion
dlrs over five years to combat acid rain.
    "This action on the part of the U.S. administration serves
well our ultimate objective of a bilateral accord providing for
a common resolution of this serious environment problem," Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said in a statement.
    Environment Minister Tom McMillan said the Reagan
announcement was a major step toward elimination of acid rain
and that Canada was pleased with the U.S. decision.
    The Reagan announcement earlier today said the
administration would ask Congress to approve 500 mln dlrs in
each of the next two fiscal years to fund innovative projects
to control smokestack emissions -- blamed for acid rain that
has killed fish and trees in eastern Canada and the
northeastern United States.
    Canada has been pressing the Reagan administration to live
up to a commitment made last year for 5 billion dlrs in
spending by the U.S. government and industry to cut toxic
emissions that cause acid rain.
    The acid rain issue has been the major irritant in
Canada-U.S. relations for several years, with Ottawa accusing
Washington of failing to act on the issue.

<TITLE>AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr
acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has
dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,
largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company
officials and analysts said.
    State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second
largest overnight courier business just two months after
another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the
acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>.
    But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies
and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out
foreign owned courier operations.
    "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
the right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
Tony Hine commented.
    The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.
companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off
their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.
    "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent
selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being
under siege or taking someone else over," he said.
    Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco
Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.
    The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,
and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of
debt by year-end, the company said.
    While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a
day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
a year.
    The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
formed an important part of a company restructuring program,
adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>,
acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
consider acquiring the whole company.
    Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier
business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a
market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman
Esther Szynkarsky said.
    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.
    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said
the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and
the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.
    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of
seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
business.
    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,
independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already
operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
door-to-door courier operation.
    "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing
well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep
it," Szynkarsky said.
    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery
network, generating traffic for the former parent companies
without them having to tie up capital in Canada.
    "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
incremental revenue," Hine said.
    "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff
through, the more money you make," he added.

<TITLE>COPPER INDUSTRY ASKS LME FOR STRATEGY STATEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Representatives of the International
Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have
told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its
forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between
industry and the LME.
    In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting
between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new
clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about
latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash
cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which
will retain the prompt date settlement basis.
    Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change
(the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental
change in the function of the LME and in its service to the
industry, the release said.
    By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and
physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages
currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from
non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.
    The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should
take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry
delegates said.
    The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no
change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on
May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given
in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by
Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.
    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance
of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry
fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of
review and change, the press release said.

<TITLE>GROUP RECONSIDERS COMPUTER MEMORIES &lt;CMIN> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A shareholder group led by Far
Hills, N.J., investor Natalie Koether said it is reconsidering
its plan to seek control of Computer Memories Inc and now plans
to sell its entire stake in the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, which includes Sun Equities Corp, said it sold a net
365,375 Computer Memories common shares between March 5 and 17
at prices ranging from 3-3/4 to four dlrs a share, lowering its
stake to 687,000 shares, or 6.2 pct of the total outstanding.
The group said it reconsidered its takeover plans after the
company announced it agreed to a stock swap.
    On March 12, the Chatsworth, Calif., computer disk drive
concern said it agreed in a letter of intent to exchange 80 pct
of its stock, all of which would be newly issued, for the
assets of privately held Hemdale Film Corp, with Hemdale as the
surviving entity.
    "In light of these disclosures, Sun found it necessary to
re-evaluate the feasibility of seeking control of the company
and has sold a portion of its shares and currently intends to
sell the balance thereof from time to time," the group said.
    The group, which disclosed plans on Dec 29 to seek control
of the company, reserved the right to change its mind again.

<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Laurentian Group Corp> said it
expects 1987 earnings per share will show about the same
proportionate increase as in 1986.
    Last year, the company had 25.7 mln dlrs operating profit,
or 76 cts per share, up from 11.1 mln dlrs, or 59 cts per
share, in 1985. Shares outstanding increased to 39 mln from
27.8 mln.
    The American holding company, Laurentian Capital Corp, will
show a substantial improvement this year, chairman Claude
Castonguay said before the annual meeting.
    Laurentian Capital Corp, which recently acquired two small
U.S. life insurance companies, had 1986 profit of 1.1 mln U.S.
dlrs, or eight cts per share, compared to seven mln U.S. dlrs,
or 68 cts per share.
    Castonguay said Laurentian Group Corp, the parent firm,
plans to fill out its national financial services distribution
system and make further acquisitions if the right opportunity
occurs.
    The company also may expand this year in continental
Europe, in conjunction with La Victoire, a French insurance
company, he said.

<TITLE>PERU SHORT-TERM TRADE CREDIT UP TO 430 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru's short-term foreign trade credit
lines, regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial
transactions, have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under
the 20-month government of president Alan Garcia.
    Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reporters
many of the credits were 90-day.
    Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in
1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments
to 10 pct of export earnings.
    Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments on
short-term debt, including trade credit lines and on about 750
mln dlrs in so-called  "working capital" credits.
    Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982, but fell in
1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks.

<TITLE>SHEARSON SELLS NEW CDS FOR JAPANESE BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said it
has sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to
provide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to the
U.S. money markets.
    The investment banker said its variable money market
certificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating
rate CDs, with the rate based on the AA commercial paper
composite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostly
institutional investors. The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and
was oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.
    The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were
Sanwa Bank Ltd, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd, Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd, each with
tranches of 100 mln dlrs, Shearson detailed.
    The investment banking firm said another series of variable
money market CDs is planned for April.
    "The variable money market CDs provide a low cost
dependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks," said
Robert Shapiro, executive vice president with Shearson Lehman
Commercial Paper Inc. "The instrument enables banks to
diversify their funding base in a significant way."
    In yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates were
set at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which
is expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis
points, Shearson said.
    The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be
subject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York
Fed's commercial paper composite rate.
    Shearson stressed, however, that the spread over the
commercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be
determined by investor demand. It added that other Japanese
banks may participate in future issues.
    "For the first time, they (the banks) will gain access not
only to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper
investors at rates which are competitive with traditional
floating rate CDs," said Michael Balaban, a vice president with
Shearson's commercial paper unit.
    He added, "For U.S. investors, the CDs are attractive
because they are domestically issued paper with competitive
rates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks."
    Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money
market funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank
paper submitted bids during yesterday's sale.

<TITLE>U.K. TO SELL OFF REMAINING 31.7 PCT STAKE IN BP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Conservative government said
it would sell off its remaining 31.7 pct shareholding in
British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> during the next financial year
which starts on April 1.
    Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the
announcement to Parliament. He said, "The government's policy is
to sell its minority holdings in companies as and when
circumstances permit.
    "As part of this policy I am now able to announce that,
subject to market conditions, the government will sell its
remaining shares in BP during the 1987/88 financial year."
    The last sale of British government shares in BP was in
September 1983. The government currently holds some 578.5 mln
ordinary shares in the company.
    Lamont said the Treasury would appoint financial advisers
for the sale. Merchant banks and stockbrokers interested in
being considered for this would be interviewed in early April.
    In September 1983, the U.K. Government sold 150 mln shares
in an underwritten offer for sale by tender. The striking price
then was 435 pence - 7.5 pct above the minimum tender price, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    He said the sale of BP shares would not cut across the
government's plans to privatise Rolls-Royce, in either April or
May, or the sale of BAA Plc, the British airports authority
which is slated for privatisation in either June or July.

said that barring any major disruption in production, it
expects 1987 gold output to top 10 tonnes after dropping to
9.223 tonnes last year from 10.251 in 1985.
    Chairman Clive Knobbs said in the annual report the mine
was expected to mill a higher tonnage while capital expenditure
during 1987 will be around 118.5 mln rand.
   The decline in gold production last year was due to a four
pct drop in tonnage milled and a seven pct decline in grade.

<TITLE>DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By TED d'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
    "The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"
said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
Congress on energy issues.
    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
proposal would be reviewed.
    Herrington said, "I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day (addition) to U.S. production." U.S. oil output was off to
8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
the year."
    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
Congress said "The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
prices and U.S. government policy."
    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
production but would only work over time.
    "Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
would not raise energy costs." Lichtblau said.
    But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said, "The members of our
trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
nation." The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
service companies.
    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
will face a stiff uphill battle.
    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
hurt consumers and some regional interests.
    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
certainly be pressure for some form of action."
     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, "a 50 pct
rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

<DATELINE>    FORT WORTH, Texas, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texstyrene Corp said it has
suspended quarterly cash dividend payments on its 9.5 pct
convertible exchangeable preferred stock.
    The suspension effects the March 15 payment, and it said it
does not expect to pay preferred dividends in the forseeable
future.
    It said the payments were suspended because of certain
covenants contained in its loan agreements. A spokesman said
the company's loss of 2,115,000 dlrs for the first 11 months as
a public company did not meet an income condition on the loans,
leading to the suspension.
    The maker of foam cups, food containers and other products
said it had 733,332 outstanding preferred shares, which had
been privately placed.
    The dividend payments on the shares amounted to 1,045,000
dlrs per year, the spokesman said.

<TITLE>SHULTZ SAYS U.S. PRODUCTS MUST BE COMPETITIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asked what the U.S. State
Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow,
Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders
that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market.
    "If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may
be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"
Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association
of Wheat Growers.
    "We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't," he
said.
    "That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets,
and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm
program and try to figure out what we should do to make it
better," Shultz told the Wheat Growers.
    Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that
would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the
American housewife, he realizes the importance of American
agricultural products being competitively priced.
    Speculation has been in the market for some time that the
United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union
at subsidized prices.
    Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it
were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials
have declined to take any official position on the issue.

<TITLE>ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain growers reduced
their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach
between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes
estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in
mid-February.
    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7
pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according
to official figures, and would be a new record.
    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct
compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.
    The change in yield estimates is due to very high
temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
northern Buenos Aires province.
    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
pods empty, especially in Cordoba.
    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since
rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.
    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There
was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.
    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were
able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,
sunflower and sorghum harvesting.
    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though
it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
recent weeks caused any long-term damage.
    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85
mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.
    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln
tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct
lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,
according to official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record
3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be
between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than
last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.
    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared
that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
crops and, consequently, on total production volume.
    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and
1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln
hectares planted in the previous harvest.
    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest
remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to
22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln
tonnes.

<TITLE>FED APPROVES CHASE MANHATTAN COMMERCIAL DEALING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve Board has
approved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage in
underwriting and dealing in commercial paper of Chase
Commercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank
holding company.
    The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application was
consistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. But
it added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last
week could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might
force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting
activities.
     The Fed said the application was similar to that of
Bankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was
approved last December.
    Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90
billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in New
York and operates in the United States and abroad.
    The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a trade
association of the investment banking industry, had opposed
Chase Manhattan's application for more powers.
    Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial
paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.
     In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place
commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates
and maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was
given authority to do.
    The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and
purchased would be 250,000 dlrs.
    The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking
laws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial
paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of
total market share.
    The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to
Chase Manhattan's regular banking activities because "this kind
of instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional
commercial loan."
    "Because of its short term nature, commercial paper is
customarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan," the Fed
order said.
    Among the benefits for the public will be increased
competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient
service for borrowers and investors, the Fed said.

<TITLE>BAKER AND VOLCKER SAY DEBT STRATEGY WILL WORK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker and
Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker have told House
leaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work,
but acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the
worse, Congressional sources and U.S. officials said.
    Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks 
yesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders.
    But the two architects of the Third World debt strategy
gave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote
economic growth and reform.
    "They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs,"
one participant at the meeting said.
    However Baker and Volcker, accompanied by Deputy Secretary
of State John Whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. "And if
things turned sour, they could turn very sour," a source quoted
them as saying.
    They were responding to questions from Wright, a Texas
Democrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his
concern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.
    The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin
American democracy and the danger that demagogues of either
left or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.
    Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing more
confidence in an optimistic outcome, Volcker was especially
concerned about the political risks, and in particular the 
fatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolving
the debt crisis would be a "struggle".
    Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year,
Wright has shown himself an able political adversary of the
administration on budget strategy.
    His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that
Congressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more
seriously now than in the past.
    More worrisome for administration strategists is the
possibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially
granting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.
    "When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office, they
knew it wasn't just talk," one source at the meeting said.
    The two economic policymakers listened patiently to
descriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility, backed
by gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.
    The agency could buy up or guarantee developing country
debt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking
economic reforms.
    The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countries
for their views under a bill approved by a House Banking
subcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce, a New York House
Democrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by Bruce
Morrison, a House Democrat from Connecticut.
    The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leaders
also attended the discussions.
    U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by the
administration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterday
the concept of debt relief was misguided. "If we write it all
off and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither
on the vine," the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital
inflows that would follow debt relief.
    Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new
innovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.
    Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on
commercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major
debtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.
    "They sat down together to discuss the implications for
Latin America and feel each other out on the best way out," a
Wright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect
the dialogue to continue.
    The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and
an uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister,
Dilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.
    Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power
over the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister
Joao Sayad is further reason to worry.
    Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial
banks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, has
been presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,
but did not come up yesterday.
    Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt,
"is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin American
issue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger," said
an aide, who asked not to be named.
    There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance by
commercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors
following substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials.
    At the State Department, Secretary of State George Shultz
is being advised the "Baker plan is going through a rough patch"
while Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt
more flexible approaches to guarantee their continued
participation in the plan.

    The 500,000-strong unitary workers' front (fut) and the
100,000-member general union of workers (ugt) have protested
the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices of up to 80
per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.
    President leon febres cordero imposed the measures after a
march 5 earthquake cost an estimated one billion dollars in
losses. About 1,000 people are dead or missing.
    The leftist-led fut said it was also backing a call by the
maoist popular movement for democracy (mpd) party, to have
congress impeach and oust febres cordero, a conservative, for
having adopted the austerity measures.
    Congress needs to muster two-thirds of the votes in the
71-seat congress to censure and oust the president, whose
four-year presidential term ends in august 1988.
    The congress last january 22 voted 38-29 to approve a
non-binding resolution asking the president to resign for
having allegedly violated laws and provoking his 12-hour
abduction by air force paratroopers on january 16.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand
situation has become more bullish recently because of
developments in the world market and increased consumption.
    Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations
subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved
the wheat outlook.
    He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about
20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also
reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings
have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of
greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union.
    "It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption
to be in far better balance than a year ago," Amstutz said.

rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of
Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said.
    Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations
subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze"
because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates
while limiting the soybean reduction.
    As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans "have a price
problem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.
    Amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the USDA, and
said "we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization

<TITLE>FLEET &lt;FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fleet Financial Group hopes its
proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the
largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning
of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.
    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for
Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring
the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date
for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July
one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.
    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that
said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be
consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate
banking outside of New England come down. "If we can consummate
the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,"
Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in
the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other
banking institution in the state.
    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only
permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be
amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.
    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,
an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase
provisions.
    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New
York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled
up by the money center giants.
    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet
and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of
interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain
permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.
Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.
    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed
merger as "a partnership of two companies." Both will continue
to operate existing headquarters after the merger.
    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one
of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one
split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the
deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.
    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion
&lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is
worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.
    Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas
Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion
dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer
deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC>
and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs
and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast
valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.
    "It's a merger of equals," said analyst John Rooney of
Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at
the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book
value was 28.02 dlrs.
    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his
60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said
Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his
retirement then Murray could assume the top post.
    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said
Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986
on the basis of the merger terms announced today.
    He noted that Fleet has a "teriffic reputation" after
having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has
established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an
innovator in securitization of mortgages.
    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion
dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar
operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.
    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations
that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would
be combined.
    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a
"lock-up" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each
granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued
shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares
outstanding.

217 to 206 to raise the national speed limit from 55 to 65
miles per hour on rural sections of interstate highways.
    The legislation would give state governments the authority
to raise the speed limit on about three-fourths of the 43,000
miles interstate system.
    The Senate has already approved the speed limit increase as
part of an 88 billion dlr federal highway and mass transit
funding bill. The bill must go back to the Senate for final
action. Congress set the 55 mile per hour limit in 1974 as an
energy conservation and safety measure.

<TITLE>VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial analysts see little chance
that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said Staley
Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the
moment we're still in a trading range."
    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
sluggish state, the analysts said.
    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
break out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee and
McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it's
not going to be news about the economy," he said.
    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
monetary policy.
    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
into the marketplace.
    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.
    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
market, he said.
    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to
the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
likely to move futures.
    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
operation did little to move cash government securities prices
late Wednesday after the close of futures.
    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
trading range)," Lacey said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO EASE EXPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A key House panel voted to greatly
ease government controls on exports as several House committees
moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws
they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.
    The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the
list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no
longer considered important to U.S. military security.
    Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign
competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S.
companies could not sell abroad.
    The issue has been the subject of administration debate.
The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions
impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current
controls should be retained but better administered.
    Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of
a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies
sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be
woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a
vote by the full House in late April.
    Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling
interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.,
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to
expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies.
    Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be
damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.
    "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of
our national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, a
New Jersey Democrat said.
    The subcommittee also called for the administration to
consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive
government procurement practices.
    The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that
the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were
treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on
lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr
Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they
were not allowed to bid on its construction.
    At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the
subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese
product--digital audio recorders.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means
Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.
telecommunications products.
     Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.
companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of
counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and
patent laws.

<TITLE>CHILEAN COPPER WORKERS ELECT LEFT-WING LEADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     SANTIAGO, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chilean left-wing leaders were
elected by the copper workers union for the first time since
the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in
a 1973 coup.
     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement
(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of
Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in
the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.
    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist
party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the
principal positions on the union's directorate.
    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces
around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln
tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter
and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.
    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's
directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian
democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by
independents.
    But the left-wing was left in control of the union after
the christian democrats and independents failed to reach
agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew
from negotiations.
    Union elections were called following the resignation of
former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.
    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union
leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court
actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.
    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national
workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO
following a strike in 1983.
    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the
past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against
the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.
     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union
leader when no longer employed by the company.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> BIDDER PLANS SALE OF AEROSPACE UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;General Partners>, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
plans to sell GenCorp Inc's aerospace and soft drink bottling
divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.
    General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer
today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct
of the total outstanding common stock.
    General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the
takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue
GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications
Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio
station licenses.
    It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying
to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc
&lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt
Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
    But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
    General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
related products.
    But it left open that it might make other changes in
GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
    Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly
obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
materials."
    "For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
prompt consummation of the transaction," General Partners said.
    Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer
for GenCorp.

    This lowered the company's debt-to-capitalization ratio

    The company also said that chemical sales accounted for 52
pct of its sales in 1986, down from 70 pct in 1981. This
underscores its strategy of shifting away from low profit
commodity chemicals in mature markets into higher value
chemical businesses in high growth areas, it said.

<TITLE>BOLIVIAN TIN MINERS START HUNGER STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     LA PAZ, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>About 9,000 miners employed by the
state corporation Comibol went on hunger strike to press for
higher wages, a miners union spokesman said.
     Victor Lopez, executive secretary of the miners union,
told a news conference the strikers began to fast in the major
tin mining districts of oruro and potosi and the action would
spread tomorrow to la paz and other areas.
     The government has charged that the strike by the miners
union, crippled by massive layoffs, is part of a left-wing
destabilisation plan to coincide with the visit of West German
president Richard von Weizsaecker, who arrives on a four-day
official tour on Friday.
     But miners union chief Simon Reyes told reporters the
strike had nothing to do with subversion and was to press for
more government investment in Comibol.
     The government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro has
streamlined the deficit-ridden state mining corporation laying
off about 20,000 miners, two-thirds of the workforce, following
a collapse of the international tin price in 1985.

<TITLE>CZARNIKOW EXPECTS LOWER EUROPEAN SUGAR OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>European sugar output on the basis of
three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white
value down on last year although yields do vary widely from
year to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review.
    European Community sowings are likely to be down compared
with last year. There have been suggestions these sowings might
respond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikow
said "it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known."
    The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates
which put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower but
Hungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.
    Czarnikow's projections in mlns tonnes white value and
three differing yields include

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)
is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow
in its monthly sugar market review.
    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's
domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export
of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be
taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and
the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.
    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75
mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports
from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export
needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to
be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may
not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.

<TITLE>GLOBAL FARM REFORM TOP U.S. PRIORITY - SHULTZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dismantling agricultural subsidies
and implementing international farm policy reform will be the
top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice
Economic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group
of American farm leaders.
    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position in
which he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told the
board of directors for the National Association of Wheat
Growers.
    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the
most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and
how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine
whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world
agriculture.
    Government policies that subsidize production and exports
have created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultz
particularly criticized European Community policies which he
said encourage domestic production by providing high government
supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with
the help of huge subsidies.
    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue
current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot
stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree to
dismantle these systems together," he said.
    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead
in agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.
officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and
have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva.

<TITLE>U.S. CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Departments of Agriculture
and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the
increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels
under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.
    Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House
Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two
departments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" on
cargo preference.
    Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food
aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually
increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost
of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation
Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said
Transportation has so far contributed no money.
    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected
to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.
    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid
shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to
meet.
    "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,
its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.
    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn
English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export
programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.
    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference
have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who
view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GDP RISES 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's seasonally adjusted real
gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter
of 1986 after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter, the
Statistics Bureau said.
    This compares with a 1.1 pct fall in the fourth quarter of
1985.
    Compared with the year-earlier quarter, GDP also rose 1.1
pct, the Bureau figures show.
    The annual rise compares with a 0.3 pct fall in the third
quarter compared with the 1985 third quarter and a 4.3 pct rise
in the year-earlier period, the Bureau figures show.
    Real non-farm gross product rose 0.9 pct in the fourth
quarter after zero growth in the third quarter and a 1.3 pct
fall a year earlier, making an annual rise of 0.8 pct.
    Gross farm product rose 4.3 pct compared with rises of 2.6
pct in the third quarter and 2.8 pct a year earlier, making
annual growth of 6.6 pct.
    Elements in the fourth quarter GDP rise included falls of
0.6 pct and 0.2 pct in private and government final consumption
expenditure respectively, the Bureau figures show.
    Gross fixed capital expenditure fell 0.1 pct in the quarter
while exports of goods and services rose 13.0 pct and imports
2.9 pct.
    Seasonally-adjusted expenditure on GDP at average 1979/80
prices rose to 36.67 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from
36.26 billion in both the third quarter and the year-earlier
quarter.
    The figures are subject to revision over a long period.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nippon Life Insurance Co> is pursing a
possible link with an American securities house to expand its
overseas investment portfolio, a company spokesman said.
    But he declined to comment on rumours the company would
take a 10 pct stake in &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers>, an
investment banking unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
    He said the firm started to sound out several U.S.
Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago
and was narrowing the number of prospects, but he did not say
if it had set its sights on one firm.
    Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, also plans to
set up a wholly owned investment unit, &lt;Nissei International
America>, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada,
Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year, he said.
    These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put
more emphasis on overseas investment management as
opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets
are growing.
    The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth
of U.S. Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm
foothold there, the spokesman added.

<TITLE>FORMER N.Z. PREMIER CALLS FOR CHEAPER CURRENCY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Prime Minister Robert
Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.
Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.
    Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate
should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.
    "A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be
between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps
around about 48 cents," he said.
    The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and
floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.
    Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and
party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by
September, have rejected his calls for a managed float.
    He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive"
interest rates for government stock.
    "I know of no other country which is implementing such a
free floating policy," he added. "There is widespread agreement
internationally that we have no alternative to floating
currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more
effective methods of managing them so as to limit the
volatility which has caused so much concern and damage."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN PROPERTY MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Thatcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Property looks set to continue to
provide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia
and Australia this year.
    A Reuter poll of property analysts, bankers and economists
around the region shows better returns are often more likely to
come from buying and selling real estate than from rental
income.
    In central Tokyo, property analysts project commercial land
prices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's
53.8 pct jump.
    The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan is
Tokyo, where the top price paid for a central commercial
property last year was 169,000 dlrs a square meter. A building
in land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3,300 dlrs a meter.
    But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply
increases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach
of foreign investors.
    Japanese investors, spurred by the yen's rise, are spending
record sums on property abroad, partly elsewhere in Asia, but
in particular in the U.S., Where Japanese investment could
double this year to 10 billion dlrs, the analysts said.
    The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will
rise steadily over the next few years, although a surge in
construction will limit increases in some areas.
    Property sales have become increasingly popular because in
some sectors of the market real estate prices, as in several
cities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields.
    "We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see
why the trend should not continue over the next few months,"
said Gareth Williams, a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong.
But he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk
linked to the return of the colony to China in 1997.
    In several other countries, analysts predicted at least
some rise in property values, which in one or two cases, such
as Thailand, could help spark a construction boom.
    Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least
seven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a
result of government assistance, low mortgage rates and a
generally bullish economic outlook.
    Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the
outlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump, one
Philippine developer said.
    Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after
five years in the doldrums, according to property developers in
Taipei. They, like counterparts in many of the region's
capitals, cited low interest rates as a major factor.
    One leading broker said the property market had become an
attractive investment in Taiwan, noting property development
yields of up to 15 pct.
    Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers. Construction
has helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s,
though foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on
property ownership, as in many parts of Asia.
    In contrast, Australia's easing of rules on foreign
investment in property, combined with financial deregulation
and a weaker dollar, has helped spark overseas interest in the
market, analysts said. But this has not always meant sales.
    "What we have seen is an increase in inquiries, particularly
from Japan, but this has yet to show itself in many new deals
being done," said Allan Farrar, executive director (real estate)
of Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group.
    Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 6.5 pct,
and one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after
15 pct rises in each of the past two years.

<TITLE>EX-REAGAN AIDE DEAVER INDICTED ON PERJURY CHARGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former White House aide Michael
Deaver, a long-time confidant of President Reagan, has been
indicted on charges of lying about his contacts as a Washington
lobbyist with top U.S. Government officials.
    The five-count perjury indictment charged that Deaver lied
in sworn testimony to Congress and before the grand jury
investigating his business affairs.
    Deaver, who resigned as deputy White House chief of staff
in 1985 to open a lobbying firm, faces a maximum penalty of 25
years in prison if convicted. Immediately after the indictment
was announced Reagan issued a statement wishing Deaver well.
    The indictment charged that Deaver lied about his contacts
with White House and cabinet officials on behalf of a wide
range of clients, including foreign governments and large
corporations.
    Charges include that he lied about his contacts when hired
by Canada to help settle a dispute over acid rain with the U.S.
And when employed by Trans World Airlines to help thwart a
takeover bid.
    Deaver issued a statement denying he had committed perjury
and predicting he would be acquitted at trial.

<TITLE>INDONESIA SEES LIMITED CHOICES ON ECONOMY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia cannot spend its way out of
recession and has very limited economic options due to lower
world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was
quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency.
    "If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as
through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might
create negative effects not only on price increases, but also
on the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen in
the North Sumatran city of Medan.
    Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its
export drive to help narrow its trade deficit.
    Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to
help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries,
which are centered in Sumatra.
    "I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation
sector in which family units are employed in great number," he
said, according to the agency.
    Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its
export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices.
    It has projected its current account deficit will widen to
over four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending
March 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Skinner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The strong contribution of exports to
the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of
the data, private economists polled by Reuters said.
    Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after
rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year
earlier.
    Equally significant was the decline in both private and
government spending, they said.
    Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth
quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau
figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government
spending by 0.2.
    Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account
deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut
imports appeared to be working.
    However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep
growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports
would increase and worsen the balance of payments.
    Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the
result was positive because growth was export-driven.
    But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the
growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.
    The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul
Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.
    Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a
reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline
in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.
    A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter
underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and
public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's
competitiveness, he said.
    "It is clear that through the continued application of that
strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its
external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth
pattern," he added.

<TITLE>FOREIGN SHARE IN JAPAN BOND SYNDICATE BOOSTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry approved the
banking industry's plan to cut its share in the government bond
underwriting syndicate to 73.8 pct from 74 pct from April 1 to
allow six foreign securities firms to participate, a ministry
spokesman said.
    Local and foreign securities housess may now underwrite
26.2 pct of 10-year bonds, up from 26 pct previously.
    Under a separate agreement, Japanese and foreign brokers
will allow the latter, including the six newcomers, to
underwrite five pct of the enlarged share, up from 1.19 pct,
underwriting sources said.
    The six new foreign brokers are &lt;E.F. Hutton and Co Inc>,
&lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc>, Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>,
&lt;Swiss Bank Corp International Asia Inc>, &lt;Sogen Security Corp>
and &lt;Swiss Union Philips and Drew Ltd>.
    The syndicate agreed after negotiation in April 1982 that
26 pct of 10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93
securities firms, 17 of them foreign, and 74 pct by banks. The
ministry later approved the arrangement.
    The Finance Ministry is also considering public tender of
notes of over four-year maturity, adding to the current two,
three and four-year note auction, the ministry official said.
    The ministry has decided to lower the eligibility standard
for foreign brokers to participate in government note auctions
by abolishing a requirement that participants have current
accounts with the bank of Japan, the official said.
    A request by four foreign banks to join the bond
underwriting syndicate is being considered, banking sources
said. The four are local subsidiaries of Continental Illinois
Holding Corp's &lt;CIH.N> Belgian unit &lt;Continental Bank SA/NV>,
Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV &lt;AMRO.AS>, &lt;Canadian Commercial
Bank> and &lt;Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises>, they said.

billion. Investment in Europe was also generally higher.
    But investment in Japan fell to 46 mln francs from 167 mln.

<TITLE>SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY'S INFLATION FIGURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's rate of inflation during
January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
    The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of
the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without
explaining how the error arose.
    Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1
pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation
rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for
January's revised figures, it added.
    Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against
a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct
in February 1986, the bureau said.
    The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the
bureau added.

<TITLE>TAIWAN STEEL FIRM SEES LOWER EXPORTS, MORE OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned &lt;China Steel Corp> said its
steel exports will drop to some 600,000 tonnes in the year
ending June 30, 1987 from more than 810,000 in 1985/86.
    Production by the company, Taiwan's largest steel maker, is
expected to rise to 3.33 mln tonnes from 3.27 mln, a spokesman
told Reuters.
    He attributed the export decline to the rise in the Taiwan
dollar, which has eroded the competitiveness of the company's
products against those from South Korea.
    The spokesman said the company is undergoing an expansion
project which calls for a boost in production to 5.65 mln
tonnes a year from the current level. The project, costing 52.3
billion Taiwan dlrs, will be completed by April 1988, two
months ahead of the targetted date, he said.
    The spokesman said the company exports its products to
Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, the U.S., The Middle East and
Africa.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES' LIQUIDITY RISES, LOAN DEMAND FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Liquidity in the Philippines rose in
December while loan demand and short-term lending rates fell,
the Central Bank said.
    A bank official said M-3 rose 9.72 pct to a provisional
149.80 billion pesos at the end of December from a month
earlier for a year-on-year gain of 12.72 pct.
    She said short-term bank lending rates fell to an
annualised 13.88 pct at the end of December, from 14.58 pct a
month earlier and 19.82 pct at the end of December 1985.
    Poor loan demand was illustrated by a rise in commercial
bank reserves, the official said.
    The bank official said commercial bank reserves were 22.19
billion pesos at the end of December, when reserves required
were 21.59 billion.
    She said the surplus of 597 mln pesos, compared with a
deficit of 390 mln pesos a month earlier and a deficit of 1.64
billion at the end of 1985, reflected political uncertainty in
the last quarter of 1986.
    Reserve money, the total available to monetary authorities,
was a provisional 52.58 billion pesos at the end of 1986. This
was 5.19 pct up from 49.98 billion at the end of November and
41.85 pct up from 37.09 billion in December 1985.
    The bank official noted M-3, which includes M-1 money
supply, plus savings, time deposits and deposit substitutes.
Was 132.88 billion pesos at the end of December 1985.
    M-1 money supply rose a provisional 17.3 pct to 42.86
billion pesos at the end of December 1986 from 36.52 billion a
month earlier. The year-on-year rise was 19.64 pct, up from
35.83 billion at the end of December 1985.
    The bank official said the broader M-2 measure, which
measures notes and coins in circulation plus savings and time
deposits, rose a provisional 9.7 pct to 140.88 billion pesos at
the end of December from 128.41 billion a month earlier. It
rose 13.35 pct from 124.27 billion at the end of December 1985.
    She said deposits with the commercial banking system rose
to just over 118 billion pesos at the end of December from
107.89 billion at the end of 1985 and 92.83 billion at the end
of 1984.

<TITLE>S. KOREA PLANS TO HELP AILING CONSTRUCTION FIRMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea is considering providing
special loans and tax benefits to ailing construction firms on
condition they stop competing with each other for overseas
contracts, government officials said.
    They told Reuters, in order to benefit under the plan
companies would be obliged to give up their licences to bid for
foreign projects.
    Sources at the construction ministry said the ministry
plans to slash the number of building firms operating overseas
to between 20 and 25, from the current 41.
    The construction ministry sources said the construction
industry had begun to adapt to drastically reduced orders from
the Middle East.
    They said the government wanted to prevent further hardship
by reducing competion between South Korean firms. Already this
year 15 firms had relinquished their licences.
    Other government officials said new foreign construction
orders fell to 2.3 billion dlrs last year, from 4.6 billion in
1985. About 30,000 building workers were laid off in 1986, one
third of the total force.
    No further details of the proposed plan were available.

Corp &lt;MD> and had taken options for a further 12 planes.
    The order, which involved rejecting the A-340 plane being

    Swissair said in December it was giving the MD-11 "primary"

    Economists in Hong Kong told Reuters that China's controls
on scarce foreign currency hurt its imports of Taiwanese
consumer goods, such as electric fans and television sets.
    Herbal medicine and textiles were among China's chief
exports to Taiwan.
    Taiwan does not allow direct trade with China and indirect

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA'S LUCKY-GOLDSTAR TO MAKE CANON CAMERAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Goldstar Precision Co Ltd>, part of
South Korea's &lt;Lucky-Goldstar Group>, agreed with Japan's Canon
Inc &lt;CANN.T> to make cameras using Canon technology, a Goldstar
spokesman told reporters.
    He told reporters Goldstar will invest 25 billion won over
the next five years and would pay Canon three pct of total
sales, which are targetted at eight billion won this year, 25
to 30 billion next year and 76 billion in 1991, as royalties.
    Most of Goldstar's output, due to start in July, will be
sold in South Korea, he said.
    However, the Goldstar spokesman said, Canon has agreed in
principle to buy an unspecified number of cameras for resale in
Japan under its own name, he said, without providing further
details.
    In Tokyo, a Canon spokesman said that under the agreement
Canon would sell facilities, components and technology worth
1.5 billion yen to Goldstar in calendar 1987 and 3.5 billion in
1988, he said.
    He said Goldstar plans to make 35-mm single-lens reflex
cameras and 35-mm compact cameras at an annual rate of 70,000
in 1987 and 200,000 in 1988.
    The camera market in South Korea is expected to expand
rapidly ahead of the 1988 Olympic Games scheduled to be held
there, the Canon spokesman said.
    South Korean camera demand rose to 700,000 in 1986 from
640,000 in 1985. Cameras made with foreign assistance accounted
for 65 pct of cameras sold in South Korea, he said.
    Minolta Camera Co Ltd &lt;MNLT.T>, &lt;Asahi Optical Co Ltd> and
Nippon Kogaku KK &lt;GAKU.T> already assemble 35-mm cameras with
South Korean partners.

imposed a penalty tax on &lt;Fuji Bank Ltd> for alleged improper
use of tax-free reserves, a bank spokeswoman told Reuters.
    She declined to reveal the bank's planned response but
another bank official said it has not paid the penalty.
    The bank said in a brief statement it believes that its use
of the tax-free reserves is legal.
    Financial institutions can set aside 0.003 pct of their
risky loans as tax-free reserves. Fuji said a difference of
understanding exists between the bank and the tax bureau
regarding the use of tax-free reserves. It did not elaborate.
    Fuji Bank reported a 72.1 billion yen net profit in the
1985/86 year. Lending totaled 16,120 billion yen.

as successful as the New York-based 100 mln dlr Korea Fund,
according to most securities analysts polled by Reuters here.
    The paid-in capital of the Korea Fund was 60 mln dlrs when
it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September 1984
and increased to 100 mln dlrs in June last year.
    The fund's net assets totalled 154 mln dlrs at the end of
last year.
    "Its (Korea Fund) runaway success was mainly due to steep
price gains on the Korea Stock Exchange ...," said Park Sin-bom,
a director of Lucky Securities Co. "The Europe Fund is certain
to benefit from this booming but closed market."
    The South Korean stock market soared last year with the
composite index, a weighted average of 355 listed shares,
rising 68.9 pct. This week the index passed the 360 level for
the first time after starting the New Year on 264.82.
    Dealers have said prices would continue to gain this year
in view of good prospects for the economy and an expected
partial opening of the market to direct foreign investment.
    However, some analysts are concerned about potential risks
such as South Korea's unstable domestic politics and the lack
of market sophistication.
    Despite the doubts, the new fund is attracting offers in
London and shares are trading at a premium of 40 to 60 pct over
their 10 dlr issue price, said officials of Ssangyong
Investment Company, one co-lead managers.
    The offer is co-lead managed by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd
of Britain and underwritten by 44 international banks and
institutional investors, including eight South Korean
securities firms.
    A foreign securities analyst told Reuters the South Korean
securities firms underwiting the issue were "greedily asking for
high premiums" in reponse to big demand.
    The portfolio will be managed on the London Stock Exchange
by Korea Schroder Fund Management Ltd, a joint venture between
&lt;Schroders Plc> of Britain and four South Korean securities
houses.
    At the moment, foreigners can only invest in the local
market indirectly through five locally-run trusts worth a total
of 140 mln dlrs, and the Korea Fund in New York.
    But the government is expected to announce guidelines for
direct outside investment on the market by October, when
foreigners holding convertible bonds issued by &lt;Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd> will have the option to trade them for
shares.
    Samsung issued 20 mln dlrs worth of convertible bonds in
December 1985, the first of three South Korean firms so far to
take the step.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out
around 30 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, bankers' balances above
target and exchequer transactions will add some 200 mln stg and
35 mln stg to the system respectively.

<TITLE>NORTH KOREA TO RESURRECT GOLD MINE TO REPAY DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pyongyang and a group of Tokyo-based
North Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean
goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two
years from 600 pounds at present, said Li Sangsu, a spokesman
for &lt;Unzan Mine Development Co>, the venture partner.
    Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase
output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70
billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.
    "We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in
gold deposits," he said.
    The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six
or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles
north of Pyongyang, Li said.
    Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would
increase yields. "Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated
methods and basic equipment."
    The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by
North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.
    Earlier this year, Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off
part of its debt with several tonnes of fish.

Minister was quoted as saying the kingdom had completed studies
on the purchase of submarines, and tenders would be invited to
supply the vessels.
    The daily al-Riyadh reported Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz as
saying: "A thorough study by the Ministry on the submarines has
been completed and it is probable King Fahd will announce the
party with which the kingdom will deal to buy them."
    He gave no further details.
    The London-based magazine Jane's Defence Weekly said last
October the Saudi government had approached six European
countries to supply between six and eight submarines at a cost
of up to 2.9 billion dlrs.
    It said Britain was expected to offer the Upholder
submarine, made by Vickers Plc &lt;VICK.L> and designed mainly for
NATO. France, West Germany, Italy, Sweden and The Netherlands
were also submitting proposals.
    British Defence Secretary George Younger said during a
visit to Saudi Arabia last month that the kingdom was
evaluating all proposals.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) farmers'
and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the
EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation
mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers.
    In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans,
current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the
mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise
oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances.
    This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil
prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted.
    If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers
should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and
incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made
available to journalists, said.
    Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially
result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC
produced oils and marine fats.
    The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and
possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose
from present levels.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Higher world oil prices, coupled with a
new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's
economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget
deficits, bankers and diplomats said.
    The months ahead will prove critical as the government
attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices
and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private
sector.
    Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to
about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could
grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982.
    But the economists said this will be possible only if the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds
in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced
to curtail output for too long.
    Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend
OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price.
    Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at
about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi
Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987.
    King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's
new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western
diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a
stable source of income for its economy.
    Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a
hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining
revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross
domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.
    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10
dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion
dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.
    "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not
be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can
afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst
effects," a diplomat said.
    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of
lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on
foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.
    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers
and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in
the longer term.
    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a
time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise
to take over the lead role in the economy.
    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of
the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it
out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion
of reserves.
    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion
riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly
recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign
borrowing has been ruled out.
    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi
businessmen this week the government had carefully considered
the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget
plans late last year.
    "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50
billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the
economy," he said.
    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early
1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and
tales of high spending became legendary.
    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the
fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management
had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.
    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,
markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut
back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.
    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but
Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate
sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.
    Government moves to encourage lending and investigate
company complaints about late public sector contract payments
could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's
industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.
    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and
more cash being placed on deposit.
    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic
development from the public to the private sector, one of the
biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel
personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom
and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

<TITLE>EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rebate granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represents some concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, EC Commission officials said.
    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)
per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed
to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into
intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos
short of the level producers said was needed, the officials
said.
    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with
producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar
for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade
it to offer higher rebates.
    They said the French and German producers involved are now
unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar
will officially enter intervention stores.
    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open
to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1
and the official payment date when the Commission officially
takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.
    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,
it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would
drive down market prices further.
    They expressed some hope that the operators would not
eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.
    "We think they realise they have gone too far," one official
said.

<TITLE>DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roughly half of this year's expected
130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
Netherlands, told Reuters.
    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
added.
    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
crop is off to a very good start," he said.
    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPECTS SUBSTANTIAL DEMAND FOR ROLLS SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Demand for shares in state-owned engine
maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> is expected to be substantial when the
government privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clark
of the group's bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said.
    He told a press conference after the release of an initial
prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to
U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public.
    As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be
made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.
    He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond
saying that a "significant proportion" would go to institutions.
    A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would
be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April
28.
    Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment
in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous
privatisations.
    Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls
was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted
that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had
several operations -- such as spare parts and military
equipment -- that evened out the swings.
    Rolls' 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986
was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary
according to changes in turnover.
    He noted that net research and development expenditure was
written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received
"inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant
forecasts of future profits." He made no forecast himself.
    In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to
120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.

<TITLE>VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,
VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
a suspected foreign currency fraud.
    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
"Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.
    Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
around three billion marks at end-1985.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian government has no immediate
plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
official of the ruling party said.
    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
which at least 15 people died.
    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
a practice discouraged by the IMF.
    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of
Agriculture economist said.

<TITLE>MEDICAL JOURNAL REPORTS NEW INTERLEUKIN PROMISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Promising new findings in the use of
a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a
cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a
Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the
magazine.
    Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp
&lt;CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp
&lt;IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.
    The journal, to be released late today, contains two
articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.
    The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding
that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search
for a successful immunotherapy for cancer.
    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally
produced by living cells in the laboratory.
    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as
a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its
effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year
later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its
ravaging side effects.
    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of
Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly
significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after
it changed the way in which the drug is administered.
    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer
patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers
and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' Stuart
Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.
    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no
remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side
effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital
care, according to the article.
    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers
administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct
remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in
melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.
    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four
patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness
of the drug's side effects as originally administered.
    "Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search
for successful immunotherapy for cancer," said the editorial,
signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.
    "These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely
did not describe successful practical approaches ready for
widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients," the
editorial said.
    "On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a
successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we
may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in
the immunuotherapy of cancer," the editorial concluded.

<TITLE>REPORT SEEKS TO DISALLOW SOUTHERN &lt;SO> COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATALANTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>An audit submitted to the Georgia
Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and
1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power
station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said.
    Southern's Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct
interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would
cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plant's
owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost
passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs.
    The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report
by O'Brien-Kreitzberg is "flawed and biased." She said the
report was released yesterday by the state attorney general.
    Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman
Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn
by the firm "are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same
bias against nuclear power that these auditors have
demonstrated in similar cases accross the country."
    Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without
fault, Scherer said "the audit identified several things I wish
we had done differently."
    Scherer pointed out a report O'Brien-Kreitzberg submitted
to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power
would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987.
    Noting "unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in
commercial operationg by June," he said the firm's latest
report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no
credit for the completion and "actually penalized us by
suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed."
    Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could
have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts,
seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.
    He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for
another year "and it would have cost several hunderd million
dlrs more."
    Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by
schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said "First, we have
the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new
government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident
significantly increased construction time.

<TITLE>FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain producers adjusted
their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
    Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
crops, including soybean.
    However, as the lands began drying later in the week
harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln.
    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
previously.
    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
tonnes.
    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
Buenos Aires in mid-April.
    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
mln tonne crop.
    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
7.1 mln.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
sown in 1985/86.
    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
this were not available.
    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
not been as intense as in previous years.

<TITLE>DUTCH ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment
rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600
at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March
1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.
    The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to
436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for
women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier
and 259,400 at end-March 1986.
    On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in
the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was
725,000.
    A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a
smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,
because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the
building industry. He said this explained the increase in the
adjusted statistics.
    Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at
end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.

    Avco Financial has 2.5 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    For the paper cut, Moody's cited a higher risk profile
inherent in the company's core business. Moody's said the
affirmation reflected its assessment of a less diversified risk

    Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard

a communique is expected to be issued.
    Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister
Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
    At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven
in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful

<TITLE>FAO REPORTS BETTER CROPS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>World output of staple foods maintained
growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and
most of the increase was in developing countries, the director
general of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
said.
    Speaking to FAO's committee on world food security, Edouard
Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production
increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to
increase production.
    Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face
problems in paying for all the food they need, he said.
    Saouma said many of the developing world's food problems
were the result of "chaotic" world trade.
    He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the
"food-security situation" of the poor, with policy reforms in
developing countries to remove existing disincentives to
production so that agriculture could play a greater role in
stimulating economic growth.

<TITLE>ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
major company executives predicted.
    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said
Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
the old ones."
    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
by as much as 300 pct, he said.
    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
history.
    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire
chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"
Oreffice said.
    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
U.S. chemical exports.
    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
in the early 1980s.
    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
    "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually
kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.
    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman
cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be
ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."
    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
along the Texas Gulf Coast.
    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
are the building blocks of specialty products.
    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand
is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

<DATELINE>    DENVER, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
it has developed superconducting wires that can easily be
formed into coils.
    It said when cooled to 91 degrees Kelvin, or 296 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit, the wires conduct electricity without
resistance.
    ATT said the wires are made of a barium-yttrium-copper
oxide compound.  It said while many engineering details remain
to be worked out, "The ability to draw the material into fine
wire and to wind the wire into coils and other forms is key for
many superconductor applications now being considered."

<TITLE>JAL BOEING CRASH CAUSED BY FAULTY REPAIRS-REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company
&lt;BA.N> was a contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd
&lt;JAPN.Y> 747 crash on August 12, 1985, that killed 520 people,
the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says.
    There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed
into a mountain north of Tokyo.
    The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by
Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the
crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the
disaster.
    The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in
late May. Under an international convention the draft must be
submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities.
    Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment. On April 4,
a Boeing spokesman at the firm's headquarters said the company
would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation
team's report until it was officially released.
    On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the
1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty. This statement did
not, however, connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the
crash.

filed a coutersuit in the U.S. District Court in Detroit

   As previously reported, Advanced's suit charges Reynolds
with pirating a computer-based voice messaging system for auto
dealer departments using confidential information it received
while test marketing the system for Advanced.
    In the countersuit, Reynolds claimed that Advanced used its
proprietary inofrmation contrary to an agreement between the
companies.
    Reynolds also said Advanced interfered with its plans to
enter the market and compete with Advanced through a public
relations campaign and other activities.
    Reynolds said its suit asked the court for injunctive and
monetary relief based on Advanced's activities.

<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Victorian Corporate Affairs
Commission, CAC, said it had suspended the futures trading
licence of G H Shintoh (Australia) Ltd after a receiver was
appointed to the company's South Australian branch.
    The one month suspension followed consultation with the
Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, which was liaising with Shintoh
concerning the open positions of its clients, the CAC said.
    The South Australian CAC had applied for the appointment of
a receiver and manager over the Adelaide office of Shintoh, an
associate member of the SFE, the CAC said.
    Shintoh's is the first licence suspended under a Futures
Industry Code introduced by Australian states from July 1,
1986, SFE chief executive Les Hosking told Reuters.
    Asiavest Pty Ltd, a commodities futures trader associated
with Shintoh and incorporated in Queensland, was placed in
receivership earlier this year, he said.

<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX> RECOMMENDED BY FIRST BOSTON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Boston Corp analyst William
Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying
"the discount that investors have made in the share price to
reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone
relative to how we expect the case to conclude."
    Texaco's stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8.
    On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme
Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texaco's bond
in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> to
one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary
injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week.
    The current litigation arose from Texaco's buyout of Getty
Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to
buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoil's
position.
     Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in
the two years since the litigation was filed, said "we
recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone
it."
    He said "the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value,
and we think it represents a good value at this level."

    But an average dollar rate of only 2.07 guilders against

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain intends to negotiate further
agreements on international securities regulation to match
those now in force with the U.S. And Japan, government sources
said.
    The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had
concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japan's Finance
Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information.
    The agreement covers stocks, shares and government bonds,
but not commodity futures, whose regulation in Japan does not
come under the Finance Ministry. It therefore does not cover
some transactions on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges.
    The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with
other countries which met in the U.K. Last December. The
meeting involved delegates from the U.K., Switzerland, the
U.S., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, France, West Germany
and Holland.
    Government sources said the deal with Japan completes
arrangements linking Tokyo, the U.S. And London. A U.K.
Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) was signed last September.
    Today's agreement will deal with requests for information
on a "case by case" basis, U.K. Government sources said. It is
not legally binding and comes into force immediately.

<TITLE>DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a
published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington
Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
    "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they
are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman Michel
Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
    "All the information that has been given out publicly is
that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an
acquisition that big...probably based on that people are
starting all sorts of rumors," he said.
    Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a
rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment
further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell
was out of town and unavailable for comment.
    Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.
    Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many"
U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington
Industries was one of them.
    Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,
which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher
Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a
takeover offer.
    Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1
mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has
repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. 
   The company has said it plans to diversify into new product
and market areas in addition to expanding its textile
operations.

<TITLE>COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    YAOUNDE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Major cocoa exporters are likely to
limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
Alliance (CPA) said.
    The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
11-member CPA which began on Monday.
    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
effort to support prices.
    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
market soon.
    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
to buy cocoa under stock rules.
    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
    "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"
commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
commodity marketing boards.
    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
first three months of 1986.
    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
dlrs in the year-earlier period.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
underwriting of Euromarket securities.
    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
personnel costs, Morgan said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Storage problems with Brazil's record
grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
problems.
    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
theoretically sufficient for the crop.
    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
capacity.
    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
storing loose grain, Brito said.
    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
crops.
    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
has been evident from television reports, which have shown
enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

<TITLE>REUTERS CHAIRMAN URGES FREER INFORMATION FLOWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exchanges and telecommunications
authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free
dissemination of information to the investment and banking
communities, Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> chairman Sir
Christopher Hogg said.
    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations
had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges
for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data
through Reuter services.
    "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.
    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that
information restrictions protected their interests.
    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the
distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage
to their own commercial information businesses.
    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
sectors.
    "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such
countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire
economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.
    Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from
the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues
to 620.9 mln stg.
    Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. The
annual shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.

<TITLE>PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of White Metals has
decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per
100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.
    The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was
introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for
some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals
association said.
    Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and
Tuesday's at 4,790.
    The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a
tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin
trading on October 24, 1985.
    The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a
French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was
reliable, the spokesman said.
    The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a
minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway
station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
    The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various
metal associations including the Association of White Metals.

<TITLE>SHAD WANTS INSIDER TRADING DEFINITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Securities and Exchange Commission
John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition
of insider trading but thought action should wait until the
Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case.
    "I'd like the benefit of the Winans decision before
deciding on a definition," Shad told a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee hearing.
    Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street
Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider
trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he
was going to write about in his column.
    The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on
Winans' recommendation.
    He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of
the SEC's enforcement activities last year despite the
publicity given to recent major cases.
    "Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct
of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading," Shad said.
    Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge 
its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal
with all types of securities fraud.
    Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S.
Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know
when his successor would be named by President Reagan.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Montedison SPA> of Italy said net
consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
    Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
    Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
    The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
    In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
1986, Montedison said.
    Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly
created position of president of Agrimont.
    Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing
director of &lt;Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing
director of &lt;Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members
of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's
board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison,
the company said.

<TITLE>MILLER SAYS REAGAN WILL REJECT TAX INCREASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Office of Management and Budget
Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax
increase called for in the House Budget Committee's 1988 budget
proposal which is before the House for a vote today.
    "It's just completely unacceptable," Miller told a House
Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and
General Government Appropriations.
    The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget
committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of
which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing
committees.
    The House committee's budget proposal includes some
increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in
taxes.
    Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit
would jeopardize the U.S. economy.
    "If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this
economic expansion that we've had in the last five years at
risk," Miller told the subcommittee.
    "The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase
substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an
end," Miller said.

    He said a public sale of 30 pct of DSM's assets in 1988 was
not unlikely, but the timing of the sell-off was entirely in
the hands of Parliament.
    Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding is known to be a
proponent of privatisation, and the centre-right government
coalition mentioned plans to privatise DSM in its policy
declaration last autumn.
    Van Liemt would not speculate on a possible market price,
but said his company had raised its total 1986 dividend to 98
mln guilders, almost 25 pct of 1986 net profit.
    "We ought to be able to match our German competitors on
price earnings ratio, although the Amsterdam bourse generally
has a lower ratio than the world's major exchanges, " he said.
    The average Dutch price/earnings ratio is 10.

abroad fell to 11.2 billion marks in 1986 from 13.6 billion in
1985, but investments in developing countries rose to 683 mln

    Foreign investments in West Germany were a net 5.8 billion
marks in 1986, up from 3.6 billion in 1985, with higher
European investments largely responsible for this increase.
    The ministry noted that, despite last year's rise in West
German investments in developing countries, the 1986 level was
below the investments of over two billion marks seen in 1981,
1982 and 1983.

<TITLE>CME ADDS COMPLIANCE CHIEF, EXPANDS SURVEILLANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,
said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will
expand its regulatory surveillance program.
    Paul O'Kelly, currently assistant regional administrator of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named
vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said.
    The expanded compliance program, which calls for an
increase in the exchange's compliance budget and addition of
staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CME's
current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased
demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said.
    The new surveillance program calls for the addition of
three floor investigators and five compliance investigators,
the CME said.
    Some of the new staff will monitor the exchange's new
Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start
July 1.
    In addition, three computer programmers will be added to
assist in regulatory support for the exchange's management
information system department.
    Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CME's
Standard and Poor's stock index futures and options division.
    A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members
from filling customer orders and trading for their own account
in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13.
    In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and
Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to
reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules.
    Included in the rule changes was the requirement that
futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal
trades to the nearest minute, intended to "enhance the
effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions,"
    "We made a promise to our members that we have kept,"
Melamed said in a release today.
    He said the new surveillance program "represents a
commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy."

<TITLE>POLAND REASSURES CREDITORS ON ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans to rejuvenate Poland's economy
by reducing central government control would help reassure
Western creditors that the country's economy was safe to invest
in, a senior Polish official said.
    "The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a
business as you might imagine," senior Polish government
spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.
    Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at
the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that
Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state
companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.
    This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in
the coming weeks, he said.
    Urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debt
burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges
but  the long term looked more secure.
    He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club,
grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortly
solve the problem of short term servicing.
    Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the
expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for
economic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."
    He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western
governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political
considerations ahead of economic co-operation.
    "After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish
economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed,
but that has not been the case," Urban said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran decided to continue its operations
east of Basra to destroy Iraq's forces, Iranian Prime Minister
Mir-Hossein Mousavi told Tehran Radio.
    "That seems to be the best spot for the complete destruction
of (Iraqi President) Saddam's forces. This is why it was
decided that the operations would forcefully continue there," he
said.
    "At the same time, we have maintained our ability to act
throughout the length of the fronts," Mousavi told the radio,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
    Tehran Radio reported over 1,500 Iraqi casualties today as
Iran continued its Karbala-8 operation launched early
yesterday.
    Iran said over 2,600 Iraqis had been killed or wounded
yesterday. Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the
latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties.
    Mousavi told Tehran radio that "on the whole, our advances
have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam."
    Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehran's
forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on
Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraq's second city.
    In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today
destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at
Iran's Ahvaz field.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The largest U.S. textile maker focused
on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
stake.
    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."
    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
Burlington actually came into play.
    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
a U.S. acquisition.
    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but
would not say whether Burlington was among them.
    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
McKinnon.
    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
competition, Gormley said.
    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"
said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
and other fabric to the auto industry.
    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
on the outlays they did make," she said.
    "You look at their record over the year, and I think
they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
past," Gormley said.
     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
from 2.01 dlrs per share.
    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
at its current levels.
    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
basis.
    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.
    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
he doesn't win the target company.
    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
Ponderosa Inc.
    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
Burlington.
    J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM>
rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.

<TITLE>JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
variety of Japanese electronic exports.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
including television and audio equipment and computers.
    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
Japan was not honoring the agreement.
    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
provide American industry with free and fair trade."
    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
    "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To
stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."
    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its
polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South
Carolina.
    The company did not disclose any prices.
    The report describes the facilities in Darlington County,
S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., the company said. The report also
decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and
technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer.
    Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of
Celanese Corp and American Hoechst Corp. The merger took place
after an agreement was reached with the Federal Trade
Commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets
of the combined companies would be divested, it said.
    Hoechst Celanese said it has the option of divesting either
the South Carolina facilities of the former American Hoechst or
a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former
Celanese.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Treasury official said there are no
plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing
yen-denominated bonds that would become known as "Reagan bonds."
    "It simply isn't something that we are planning to do," the
official said.
    He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports
suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as
the former Carter administration did when it sold "Carter bonds"
denominated in West German marks.
    But he said the situation was greatly different now.
    "If you look at the differences between the treasury market
now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more
global market now," the official said.
    "There was not the same ease then for the holder of another
currency to buy other countries' securities," he added, "But
there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy
U.S. securities."
    The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay
its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue
yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.

dispute with Union Rural Electric Association of Brighton,
Colo.
    The company said, "The tentative agreement protects Union's
boundaries and also would set in motion a vote of Union's
membership, which could lead to acquisition of Union by Public
Service Co."
    Union provides electrical service to about 14,000 members
in cities and rural areas north of Denver.
    The company said the settlement, which is pending before
the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, is under review by
the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which
supplies power to Union, and is subject to approval by the
Public Service Colorado board and Union's membership. It also
will be discussed with the Colorado Rural Electric Association.
    It said legislation that would halt the acquisition of
electric utility service territories by annexation will remain
active in the Colorado House of Representatives until Union and
Public Service assure legislators they are in agreement.

<TITLE>ADVANCED MICRO &lt;AMD> UNVEILS COMPUTER CHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Advanced Micro Devices Inc said it is
developing a set of five computer chips for use in digital
communications systems.
    The company said the new chips support the integrated
services digital network, or ISDN, the international standard
for digital voice and data communications.
    Advanced Micro also said it has signed a licensing
agreement with American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> under
which ATT has provided it with certain digital communications
specifications.
    Today's announcement follows the company's introduction
last week of a 32-bit microprocessor.
    "We have now reached a key point in the development of
communications devices that implement a worldwide ISDN
standard," said John East, group vice president for Advanced
Micro's logic businesses.
    He said the company's new computer chips, to be available
by the end of this year, should boost the acceptance and
implementation of ISDN services.
     The chip set includes five separate devices in 100 unit
quantities. The devices are priced from 7.25 dlrs to 29.25
dlrs. Similar chip sets for ISDN communications are already
being sold by a number of companies including INTEL Corp
&lt;INTC>, ATT, Rockwell International &lt;ROK> and a joint venture

report a loss of about 300,000 dlrs or five cts per share for
the first quarter, compared with a profit of 1,081,000 dlrs or
19 cts per share a year before.          
    The trucking company attributed the loss to the continued
rate of discounted in its primary markets, flat revenues and
increased costs, including uninsured claims expense resulting
from adverse weather conditions during the last three months.
    It said results outside the Northeast were strong, and it
expects to show improved results for the rest of the year.

Government securities market and offered to buy all maturities
of Treasury notes and bonds, a Fed spokesman said.
    He said this coupon "pass," which adds permanent reserves
to the banking system, was for regular delivery tomorrow.
    Dealers said that Federal funds were trading at 6-7/16 pct
when the Fed announced the operation. Economists had been
expecting the Fed to do this because of the need to offset
seasonal factors expected to drain reserves heavily over the
next few weeks. The Fed had previously offered to buy all
coupon issues on March 31.

ended its stalemate over a budget plan and approved by a single
vote a revised 1988 budget proposed by chairman Lawton Chiles
to cut the deficit to 133.7 billion next year.
    The new plan broke last week's gridlock in which the
committee failed to approve a similar Chiles plan on a tie
vote. Today, the measure was sent to the Senate 13 to 11.
    Among a series of changes to get the extra vote, Chiles
added about 400 mln dlrs for additional, unspecified,
agricultural spending programs to be paid with partly with

<TITLE>QUEBEC GOVERNMENT TO OFFER HELP TO NORANDA MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUEBEC, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said
the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open
(Noranda Inc)'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by
fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure
until damage estimates have been completed.
    Federal member of parliament for the region, Charles-Eugene
Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared
to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as
possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about
10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more
specific estimate by the end of the month.
    Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but
has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access
to the burned-out area.
    Noranda said the mine was not insured.
    "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all
of Noranda's underground operations would have been
prohibitive," Larry Taylor, Noranda's risk management and
insurance director, said.
    Taylor said before last week's fire, the company had only
had one previous mine accident many years ago.
    Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other
underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have
started on a new conveyor system.
    Noranda has said it would take four to five months to
return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced
72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10,
taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg
from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International
Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.
    The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to
150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.
    The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over
a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability
had warranted a cut in deposit rates.
    The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after
consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the
spokesman said.
    The cuts were likely to attract more business to the
market, he said.

<TITLE>MUNSON &lt;MGEO> GETS PROJECT FINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RENO, Nev., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Munson Geothermal Inc said it
received the necessary financing to complete construction work
at its Brady Hot Springs facility and begin commercial delivery
of geothermally produced electricity to Sierra Pacific Resouces
Corp &lt;SRP> by July this year.
    Munson has a 30-year contract which calls for it to supply
Sierra Pacific with about 23.5 megawatts of electricity per
year, a spokesman said.
    Munson, a wholesale electric utility, said the financing
consists of a 1.25 mln dlr credit agreement with a division of
Foster Oilfield Co of Houston.
    Trading in Munson's stock was halted earlier, news pending.
It last traded at a bid of 2-3/8 and an offer of 2-1/2.
    In addition, Munson said that since closing its 1.2 mln dlr
limited partnership at Brady in December 1986, the company has
raised about 500,000 dlrs through private placements with
qualified investors.
    The funds will be used to help finance commercial startup
of the Brady facility, Munson also said.

<TITLE>PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC &lt;PE> NUCLEAR COST ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philadelphia Electric Co will have
to spend an average of about five mln dlrs a day to replace the
electricity which would have been generated by the Peach Bottom
nuclear power plant, Chairman J. Lee Everett said.
    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the utility to
close the plant early last week.
    "This is the first time an operating plant has been shut
down by the NRC specifically because of plant operator
problems," Everett told the company's annual meeting.
    He did not say who would pay for the replacement power --
rate payers or shareholders.
    Everett told the meeting Philadelphia Electric can not give
a definitive answer on the cost of the shutdown until it gets
Peach Bottom back in service.
    He said the utility had been aware for some time it had
attitude problems among the operating forces at Peach Bottom
and thought it had been making progress toward improvement.
    "While the attitude of operating personnel at Peach Bottom
has been rated poor, the attitudes or our personnel at
Limerick, our other nuclear plant, have been rated excellent.
We have asked ourselves over and over how two plants, managed
by the same company, can be so different."
    Everett said "Limerick has been the model for improvements
we set out to accomplish at Peach Bottom, and remains so."
    He said a special committee composed of Philadelphia
Electric's outside directors will monitor and direct the
company's investigation of the problem.

<TITLE>HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Emma Robson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
to extend world penetration.
    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We
have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that
while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
regionalized.
     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
important beer growth markets in the long term.
     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
1986 sales.
    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
have been looking at other possibilities.
    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not
possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.
    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
money.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Colombia government trade official has
urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
    Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
Colombia's major export.
    The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.

<TITLE>TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey said today its disputes with
Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, should be solved through negotiations.
    A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between
the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute
and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,
economy and other rights of both countries.
    "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be
found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has
repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the
International Court of Justice.
    The two countries approached armed confrontation last month
after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the
Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.
    A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to
territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic
opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,"
the Foreign Ministry statement said.
    Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to
meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek
reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed.

<DATELINE>    HAVANA, APRIL 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuba will continue to develop its economy
despite the need to cut imports from hard currency nations by
half this year, President Fidel Castro said.
    The Cuban economy is going through a difficult period due
mainly to two years of drought, low sugar prices, a fall in the
price of petroleum and the fall in the value of the dollar,
Castro said in a published weekend speech delivered to a young
communists union congress.
    Castro said  cuba will continue to prospect for oil, build
thermo-electric generating stations, a large petroleum refinery
and a nuclear power plant in 1987.
    He said work would also continue this year in developing
the chemical and mining industries. Among the main projects in
mining are two nickel processing plants built with Soviet and
Comecon aid .

<TITLE>GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The official in charge of
agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is
in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and
Reagan administration officials.
    Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning
with members of the House Agriculture Committee.
    Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over
protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers
noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan
rates, committee staff said.
    "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan
rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source
said.
    De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with
Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended
the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by
subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.
    Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture
members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.
    Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means
Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before
visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
    De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North
America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in
the key GATT member states.
    The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting
in February and is expected to meet again in May.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates."
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
to four pct rate in 1987.

<TITLE>MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
1988.
    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better
off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
or share repurchases," he said.
    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
double that by 1995.
    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new
products and start building market share if we have to beg,
borrow or steal to get into new markets."
    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish
our company as the quality leader in the industry."
    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
the company intends to diversify internally and through
acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
such as drug delivery systems.
    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some
safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
from an acquisition."
    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
activity.
    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
rate responsive pacemaker.

<TITLE>IBM &lt;IBM> NAMES NEW PRESIDENT FOR ROLM UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ARMONK, N.Y., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Business Machines
Corp said IBM vice president Ray S. AbuZayyad has been named
president of its ROLM Corp subsidiary, succeeding Dennis D.
Paboojian, who remains with IBM as a consultant.
    The company said IBM vice president Paul R. Low has been
named president of the IBM General Products Division,
succeeding AbuZayyad, and IBM vice president Michael J. Attardo
has been named president of IBM's General Technology Division,
succeeding Low.
    A Rolm spokeswoman said Paboojian decided to step down for
personal reasons.
    His decision, she said, was not related to IBM's move last
month to merge Rolm's sales and service organization into its
own marketing corps.
    That merger was viewed by some analysts as reducing Rolm's
independence and relegating it to a role as a manufacturing and
product development site within IBM.
    "He wanted to take some personal time off," she said,
adding that Paboojian had taken part in the merger decision.
    Scores of Rolm veterans have left the company, which makes
telephone exchanges and other communications equipment, since
it was acquired by IBM in 1984.
    Rolm's highly respected founder, Ken Oshman, left more than
a year ago.
    Rolm and IBM customers have complained about a lack of
coordination between Rolm and IBM, and analysts estimate the
unit lost money last year.
    But the spokeswoman said Paboojian was "happy with the way
things are going with Rolm." She said the unit posted its best
fourth quarter revenues ever in the 1986 fourth quarter.

<TITLE>U.K. CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CAPITAL SPENDING SEEN UP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Capital spending in the U.K. Chemical
industry is expected to rise to 1.4 billion stg this year, a
three pct increase on the 1986 level after inflation, the
Chemical Industry Association said.
    A further increase to 1.52 billion stg is expected in 1988,
but there will be a decline to 1.38 billion in 1989, the
association found in its latest investment intentions survey.
    Even so, the estimated total fixed capital spending for the
1987-89 period of 4.3 billion is a real spending increase of
six pct on the previous three years, the report said.
Eighty-one firms took part in the survey.

<TITLE>GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM> SETS SHUTDOWN DATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp said it set dates to
shut down two of its truck and bus facilities that had been
slated for closure.
    General Motors said its number one line at its Flint,
Mich., truck and bus assembly plant will be closed May 29. The
company said the closing was in line with its announcement last
November that it would close 11 plants. At that time, General
Motors said the line would be closed "by August."
    At Flint, "layoffs could reach 2,000," the automaker said.
Some 1,400 workers on the line will be transferred to other
locations or put in a job placement program. The second line at
the plant is not affected.
    General Motors also said it will close the truck and bus
plant in St. Louis on August seven.
    General Motors did not specify how many of the 2,200
workers at the facility would be laid off, but said "many of
those employees will be transferring toother General Motors
operations in the area."
    In the automaker's previous announcement, it said the
facility would be closed by "mid-1987."
    General Motors said the full-size pickup trucks currently
being built of Flint's Line One are being replaced by a new
full-size pickup truck being assembled at Fort Wayne, Ind., and
at renovated plants in Pontiac, Mich., and Oshawa, Ont.
    The St. Louis plant makes full-size pickup trucks,
including crew cab models. The production is being phased out
as the Fort Wayne, Pontiac and Oshawa plant begin to produce
General Motors' new redesigned 1988 full-size pickup. Crew cab
truck output is being shifted to Janesvile, Wis.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Discussions on the possible extension of
the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the
quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but
the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member
states.
    A number of producer governments in particular have not
decided their final position on whether the ITA should be
extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on
June 30, according to delegate sources.
    Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to
back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which
undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.
    Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member
countries declare their positions on the possible extension.
Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT
after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC
coordination meeting.
    The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although
delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor
technical matters and the main issue will probably not be
discussed before the afternoon session.

avoid them.
    Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the remark one
day before U.S. And Japanese officials are to meet under the
emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to
discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.
    Fitzwater said: "I would say Japan is applying the
full-court press...They certainly are putting both feet forward
in terms of explaining their position." But he added that "all
indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."

<TITLE>EC PLANS FOR CASH PAYMENTS TO FARMERS IMPEDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, France, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Controversial plans to pay
Western Europe's surplus-producing farmers generous cash grants
to leave the land ran into problems at today's weekly meeting
of the European Community (EC) Commission, officials said.
    They said the 17-member Commission, which effectively runs
the Community on a day-to-day basis, appeared divided over the
proposals which some people argue could lead to national
capitals having too much say in EC farm policies.
    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing paying
farmers as much as 2,800 dlrs a year over five years to leave
the land. EC member states would be permitted to top up
payments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the average
national farm income.
    The package would also include an early retirement scheme,
details of which have yet to be unveiled.
    Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy --
the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted food
production -- more acceptable to countries with large farming
communities.
    With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budget
swallowed up by EC farm supports, he argues that in the
long-run the payments would lead to considerable savings.

<TITLE>SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showboat Inc will take a
charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
as it had been able to do previously.
    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
was completed earlier in the week.

<TITLE>SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Security Pacific Corp said it is
placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a
non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first
quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
taxes.
    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
reported for the first quarter of 1986.
    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
February.
    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
country's export revenues.
    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record
interest income only as it is received in cash.
    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
later in 1987.
    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York
when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask
banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
debt that matures on April 15.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said today its troops were pushing
Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied
when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of
Basra early yesterday.
    A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a
significant victory and were continuing to advance.
    Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km
(six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied
ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three
divisions attacked.
    The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under
assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery
and tanks.
    "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge
the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.
    (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)
    The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil
installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid
today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot
down.
    Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of
the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore
terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to
attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

products to be inspected at their point of arrival in the

    Donald Houston, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and

USDA was developing a proposed change in regulations that would
put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat
products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another
port.
    Houston said the requirement would be phased in over
several years to "avoid disruptions and economic hardship."

<TITLE>UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide
proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed
evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta
area.
    "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
development of this discovery will not be economical without
substantially higher prices," the company said.
    Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
the Gulf of Mexico.
    In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
well as petrochemical-related businesses.

<TITLE>UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>UAL Inc may have a response this
afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
    "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding
that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released
today.
    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
held discussions with its chairman.
    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
mln shares.
    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
strategy to become a travel service company.
    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
on its airline.
    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
the stock is in play.
    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
    "The first domino is you have an investor with a
considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"
said Pettee.
    "What's interesting is the values are there. There's
something for everybody," he said.

<TITLE>HARTMARX &lt;HMX> TARGETS EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hartmarx Corp, following a year of
restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal
1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.
    Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
    The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
ago.
    Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to
take advantage of acquisitions."
    In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
    He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store
which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

<TITLE>SALOMON &lt;SB> SEES MORE STOCK GAINS WORLDWIDE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc say
the outlook for stock markets worldwide is postivie, although
total returns in the U.S. stock market are not expected to
exceed 10 pct over the next 12 months.
    The report by Robert Salomon Jr and Caroline Davenport said
that after a strong first quarter, which saw U.S. stock market
indices rise more than 20 pct, the direction of the market is
still upward because slower economic growth will stretch out
the recovery period. The firm expects profits for companies in
the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index to rise 17 pct in 1987
and 18 pct in 1988. 
    The bullish global outlook is underpinned by continued but
subdued economic growth, fiscal restraint, good liquidity and
increasing profits, Salomon said.
    The Salomon analysts say potential risks which must be
monitored include any shift toward protectionism and foreign
buying of U.S. stocks particularly by the Japanese. "A sharp
run-up in stock prices in secondary stocks" would be a warning
sign, as would a big increase in enthusiasm for the initial
public offering market," Salomon said.
    Salomon said global diversification of equity markets has
reached a new peak.

<TITLE>FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Heller, a member of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well," he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future," he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.
    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets," Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller
said.

<TITLE>INDUSTRIAL NATIONS RECONVENE FOR TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial ministers and central
bankers of leading industrial nations reconvened here this
afternoon.
    Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said on entering
the meeting the ministers would review the Paris agreement.
Asked if he was satisfied with West German and Japanese
stimulus, Wilson replied, "They could do a little more."
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, meanwhile,
confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the
meeting.
    Finance ministers and central bankers of Britain, FRance,
Canada and West Germany were seen by Reuter correspondents
returning to a Treasury building.
    Japanese officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier
Group of Five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time
(1800 gmt).
    There was no sign, however, of the Italian delegation whose
position was thrown into question this morning by the
resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's
Socialist-led government.
    European monetary officials said later that the Italian
delegation was inside the building.
    This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven
was in progress.

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. meat and poultry inspection
programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
consumers charged.
    "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
meat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.
    "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident
about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
today," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community
Nutrition Institute.
    "Company management is less concerned about the risk to
health than about raising plant output and company profits,"
Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.
    Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government
Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose
violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in
the entire inspection system."
    Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to
flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
their noses."
    Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended
the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected
public health programs in the world."
    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
billion chicken and turkeys every year.
    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
the meat and poultry supply has increased.
    He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
and much money to contain the growing problem.
    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw
pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.
    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
    "We certainly really have not found an effective means of
turning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)
    The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS
intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
detecting microoganisms.
    But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
would cost too much.
    "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
economical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling,
executive vice president of the National Association of Meat
Purveyors, said.
    Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new
program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at
certain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be
repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic
of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor
legal recourse."
    Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the
panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C> RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO> PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
negotiations.
    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by
April 23."
    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the
deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."
    The March letter of intent between the two companies says
that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
statement that more time was needed because the talks are
complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.
    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
by a written agreement by both companies.
    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward
a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is
not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
trouble: "There are no glitches."
    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "I
can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

<TITLE>GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Electric Corp said its
first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
    General Electric also attibuted continued strong
performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
    GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
are in line with those expectations.
    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
its strong earnings.
    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
taxes from an inventory accounting change.
    And technical products revenues and operating profit were
ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's
communications and related services.

<TITLE>TECK STILL IN TALKS ON B.C. COPPER VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Teck Corp> said it
was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at
Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco
Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when
negotiations would be completed.
    Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in
reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long
time." He declined to speculate on the outcome.
    Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is
optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don
Townson told Reuters.
    "I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be
resolved," Cominco's Townson said.
    "We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he
added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.
    Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January
1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley
copper operations.
    Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management
of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct
share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.
    For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture
officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore
milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct
copper, Townson said.
    Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of
copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum
in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of
gold, he said.
    A consortium, 50 pct owned by Teck and 25 pct each by MIM
(Canada) Inc and Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd, acquired its
Cominco stake last year from Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP>.

<TITLE>AIRLINE FARE DISCLOSURE BILL PROPOSED IN SENATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8, Reuter - </DATELINE><BODY>Angered by late flights and
complicated restrictions on discount air fares, a senator has
introduced legislation to make airlines provide more details on
fares and schedules in their advertisements.
    Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the bill's sponsor, said airline ads
now are often misleading because they do not give prospective
passengers enough facts about discount fares.
    "Air travelers are lured by low advertised fares which
simply aren't available," the New Jersey Democrat said in a
statement. "It's the old bait and switch."
    Airline advertisements usually say discount seats are
limited, but Lautenberg said more information was needed.

<DATELINE>    LOS GATOS, Calif., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Xebec Corp said it expects to
report a loss for its second quarter ended April three, due
principally to a decline in sales to International Business
Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, the company's largest customer.
    Xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln
dlrs.
    The company reported a second quarter loss last year of 1.9
mln dlrs, or 14 cts per share, on 23.9 mln in revenues.
    Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct
of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during
the quarter just ended.
    IBM had used Xebec's hard disk drive controller products in
the IBM PC/XT, a product which IBM is phasing out.
    Xebec said it intends to continue streamlining its
operations in light of the loss of business.
    The company also said it has already consolidated two of
its plants in Nevada and it now plans to sell unused and
surplus assets to provide additional liquidity.

delivered at its annual meeting in San Francisco, reiterated
its expectation of a loss in the first quarter.
    It said results would be hurt by a 25 mln dlr one-time
charge by Caterpillar Mitsubishi, a 50-pct owned affiliate. The
company said it expected profit from operations for the full
year to improve over 1986.
    In remarks prepared for delivery to shareholders, President
Peter Donis said Caterpillar's targeted five pct cost reduction
in 1987 "will be difficult to achieve because the weaker dollar
has limited opportunities to obtain lower material costs."

<TITLE>AIRBUS SIGNS ACCORD ON CFM ENGINE FOR A340 PLANE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European &lt;Airbus Industrie> consortium
today formally signed an agreement with the Franco-U.S. Group
&lt;CFM International> for an improved version of the CFM56-5
engine to power the A340-200 and A340-300 aircraft, an Airbus
statement said.
    Airbus said yesterday that it chosen the CFM56-5-S3 engine,
to be produced by &lt;General Electric> of the U.S. And &lt;SNECMA of
France, because the &lt;International Aero Engine> (IAE) high
technology superfan engine would not be ready by early 1992,
when the A340 plane is due to become operational.
    The five-nation IAE consortium has decided not to go ahead
with the proposed launch of the superfan, a spokesman for
consortium member &lt;Rolls-Royce Plc> said today, adding that the
project had not been cancelled and could be offered later on.
    Airbus said the CFM56-5-S3 will have a thrust of 30,600 lbs
and an improved fuel burn of four per cent compared with the
CFM56-5A1 which is now being operated on the A320 flight-test
aircraft. It will be available for deliveries of the A340 in
May 1992.
    At the same time, the Airbus statement said Airbus
Industrie and General Electric have concluded an accord for an
improved version of the GE CF6-80C2 engine, with 64,000 lbs of
thrust and a three per cent improvement in specific fuel
consumption, to power the A330 aircraft which will be
introduced in spring 1993.
    "This continues the long-standing history of all Airbus
launches being made with either GE or CFMI engines," Airbus
Industrie president Jean Pierson said in the statement.
    "Airbus Industrie has already worked with CFMI to launch one
new aircraft programme - the A320 - in early 1984, and is happy
to build on this relationship by launching the A340 with an

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's purchase of about 2.4
mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to
double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
tonnes from the United States.
    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in
light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from
China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Group of 24 developing countries
said in a communique that some kind of debt relief is necessary
and called for "a new attitude" on the part of the banks.
    The communique, released in conjunction with the semiannual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
said the very low income countries needed a cancellation of
debt to industrial countries, a conversion of part of their
debt into grants and a rescheduling on concessional terms.
    For some other countries, the communique said, the debt
cannot be properly serviced if the countries are to grow at the
same time.
    "The debt overhang effects the capacity to grow as it
reduces the ability to import," the communique said.
    It added: "Some kind of debt relief and a new attitude on
the part of the banks is necessary."
    The communique added that debtor countries and banks have
to explore new market mechanisms, debt into equity swaps,
capitalization of interest and writeoffs.

<TITLE>PERU DECREES FIRMS SHOULD BUY TREASURY BONDS </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>the Peruvian government decreed that a wide
range of firms would have to earmark between 20 and 30 pct of
their 1986 net profits to buy treasury bonds this year.
    A presidential decree said that banking, financial and
insurance firms as well as bottling and tobacco industries with
1986 sales of more than 1.6 mln intis would have to earmark 30
pct of their net profits from last year to buy the bonds.
    The bonds would be redeemed over the next two years and
their interest rate would be set by the central bank. Textile,
commercial and fishing canneries with sales over 1.24 mln intis
would have to buy bonds equal to 20 pct of profits.
    The firms would have to buy the bonds between April and
December 1987.
   The decree said the government adopted the move to obtain
financing for high-priority investment projects, which it did
not specify.
    The economy ministry says it aims to keep the public
sector's budget deficit to between five and six pct of the
gross domestic product (gdp).
    Last year, the deficit was six pct of gdp, according to the
central bank.

States from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the
right jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for
bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to
identify Mexican steers.
    The requirement is not expected to affect the number of
Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand
will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of
entry.
    Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export
quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87
season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.

    The company reported a profit of 365,883 dlrs, 23 cts a
share, for the first quarter last year with one cent a share
coming from non-operating factors, a spokesman said.
    Miller attributed the expected loss to completion of the

and taking more time than originally anticipated.
    Vulcan is working to resolve the problems, Miller told
shareholders, adding it appears it will take most of 1987 to
find solutions.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department is
seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
collateral or under price support programs.
    The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
    The department said it is possible that producers could be
encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
the premiums and discounts.
    Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is
required by law by May 10.

<TITLE>NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR> TO SELL SPIRITS UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its spirits
division for 545 mln dlrs to James Beam Distilling Co, a unit
of American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
    The sale of the spirits division was made under the
company's previously announced plan to sell its spirits and

    The purchase price will be paid in cash, a National
Distillers spokeswoman said.
    The sale permits National to focus on its core businesses,

other corporate purposes, the company said.
    In a separate statement, American Brands said the sale
would be for 545 mln dlrs plus the assumption of liabilities.

Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other
regulatory approvals, the company said.

580 mln dlrs, American Brands said. National's spirits brands
include Gilbey's gin and vodka, DeKuyper Liqueurs and Windsor

<TITLE>WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve will promote lower
interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
subverting national U.S. economic policy.
    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.
    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.
    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates
and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up
seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

<TITLE>CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada plans to monitor steel shipments
flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease
concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel
exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.
    "To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,
the government is taking further action to ensure we have more
accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not
used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"
Carney said.
    Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to
exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were
considering establishing a joint commission to study the
growing steel problem.
    Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an
amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the
monitoring program.
    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the
level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.
    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic
steel industry.
    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
American market be limited to 2.4 pct.

<TITLE>U.S.SENATE LIFTS SOME BANS ON NATURAL GAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate unanimously approved
legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural
gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning
plants.
    The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
pay higher than market prices.
    "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the
Lousiana Democrat said.
    The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
    "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"
Johnston said.
    In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new
baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate
modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate
fuel.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM LAND VALUE DECLINE MODERATES--USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of U.S. farmland declined
again last year, but less than in the previous year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Agricultural Resources Report, the
department said on February 1, 1987, the average value per acre
of farmland stood at 548 dlrs, down eight pct from a year
earlier. Values dropped 12 pct in 1985, it noted.
    Real values, which are adjusted for inflation, also
declined less than in 1985, because of the low rate of
inflation in 1986.
    Real values fell 10 pct compared to 14 pct in 1985, it
said.
    The department said in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains,
which suffered severe losses in the past five years, declines
appear to be moderating. Also there are reports of stable
values in some areas of the Corn Belt, it noted.
    The continuing downturn in values reflects the large
acreage of land offered for sale relative to demand, concern 
about lower crop prices, and uncertainty over farm programs,
the department said.
    Those factors tend to offset the effects of relatively high
cash farm income, lower interest rates, and reduced operating
expenses, it said.

<TITLE>SOUTHEAST BANCORP &lt;STB> ACTS ON BRAZILIAN DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following the lead of other major
banks, Southeast Banking Corp told the Securities and Exchange
Commission it would place 54.2 mln dlrs of medium- and
long-term Brazilian debt on non-accrual or cash status.
    Based on current interest rates, it estimated in a filing
that the move will reduce net income by about 800,000 dlrs in
the first quarter and 3.2 mln dlrs for all of 1987. The company
also said it did not believe the Brazilian debt situation would
have a "material adverse" effect on it.
    It also said it would issue 1,080,000 common shares in
connection with its acquisition of Popular Bancshares Corp.

<TITLE>WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> SEES FLAT PIPELINE VOLUMES IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Williams Cos said it expected oil and
fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
charge was incurred.
    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
billion in 1985.
    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
changes tariff and federal tax rates.
    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ministers from the Group of 24
developing coutries said that the debt crisis was entering a
new and dangerous phase and called for the formation of a
ministerial committee to examine solutions to the problem.
    In a statement following a meeting of the ministers, they
said that the "existing (debt) strategy offers no prospect for a
lasting solution to the debt problem."
    The statement said that there should be a new attitude and
approach in respect of the existing stock of debt and called
for current flows and future credits to be examined by
governments, multilateral and banking institutions.
    The statement also said that the prospects of the least
developed countries continue to deteriorate and "will improve
only if commensurate financing on concessional terms is made
available."

    Today, May futures in New York settled at 107.90 cents a

<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> STAYS ON S/P WATCH, NEGATIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it is
keeping 230 mln dlrs of debt of Caesars World Inc and Caesars
World Finance Corp on creditwatch with negative implications.
    S and P cited Caesars World's proposed recapitalization
plan that calls for incurring one billion dlrs of bank and
other debt to finance a 25 dlr per share special dividend and
the repayment of about 222.5 mln dlrs of existing debt.
    It said the plan's terms would violate dividend convenants
in the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing of
those issues. Caesars was placed on creditwatch for a possible
downgrade March nine following investor Martin Sosnoff's bid.
    Sosnoff bid 28 dlrs per share, or 725.2 mln dlrs, for the
86.4 pct of Caesars World stock he does not already own,
Standard and Poor's noted.
    The rating agency said an increase in Sosnoff's offer is
possible. If successful, the stock bid would markedly raise
Caesars World's financial risk and lead to a large drop in net
income and cash flow, S and P said.
    Caesars World currently carries BB senior debt and B-plus
subordinated debt. The finance unit's subordinated debt, which
is guaranteed by the parent, is rated B-plus.

<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, Ga., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>HBO and Co said it sent a letter of
strongly urging shareholders not to sign any proxy cards sent
by Andover Group.
    ON March 30, Andover Group, a two-man general partnership
which owns about seven pct of HBO's stock, filed preliminary
proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission
seeking to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the
company's April 30 annual meeting.
    Andover had expressed an interest to acquire the company in
September 1986 but HBO has never received an offer from them,
it said.
    In addition, HBO said its financial condition is improving
rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
implemented in 1986.
    It expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts
per share in 1987 and a very significant increase in 1988.
    For the year ended December 1986, the company reported a
loss of 3.6 mln dlrs, or 16 cts per share.

conversion, and claims of 50 mln dlrs in punitive damages
sought by the companies, &lt;Apple Records Inc>, &lt;Apple Corps
Ltd>, and former Beatles, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and the
widow of John Lennon, Yoko Ono. Paul McCartney was not party to
the suit.
    The Beatles brought the suit against Capital Records Inc
and EMI Records Ltd, two units of Thorn-EMI.
    The Beatles charged the record companies with defrauding
them by not paying royalties on sales of various recordings
over the past 18 years.
    A spokesman for the company in New York said while the
court dismissed six of the nine actions involving punitive
damages, three actions remain, with 30 mln dlrs in claims for
royalties.

<TITLE>HAWKEYE &lt;HWKB> 1986 ANNUAL REPORT QUALIFIED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DES MOINES, IOWA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hawkeye Bancorp's 1986 annual
financial results were qualified by its auditors, according to
the annual report.
    "...there are conditions which may indicate that the
company will be unable to continue as a going concern,"
auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual
report to shareholders.
    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its
obligations for the next 12-month period."
    Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
and five non-bank operations for disposition.
    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to
survive as a going concern," the report said.
    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory
agreements and on its ability to return to profitable
operations, it said.
    There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet
these requirements. However, the company "believes it will be
able to do so," Hawkeye said.

<TITLE>S/P SEES STABLE CREDIT QUALITY IN FIRST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said that
corporate credit quality stabilized in the first quarter of the
year, even though downgrades outpaced upgrades.
    S and P said it reduced 79 debt ratings, affecting 63
billion dlrs of debt securities, and raised 28 ratings,
affecting 12 billion dlrs of debt.
    However, the rating agency pointed out that last quarter's
number of downgrades was the lowest since first quarter 1986.
It also said the upgrades were the fewest since early 1986.
    It said rating changes quieted in the oil and insurance
sectors, while utilities provided a positive influence.
    Standard and Poor's said its major downgrades last quarter
were of Denmark, USX Corp &lt;X>, Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>.
    It said the most negative influence on rating changes
occurred in the financial institution sector, where there were
22 downgrades versus five upgrades.
    Notably, ratings were reduced for several of the largest
U.S. bank holding companies, reflecting lower asset quality and
weaknesses that were specific to those firms, S/P said.
    Among industrials, S and P cut 43 ratings and raised 10.
Lower ratings prevailed in steel and health care, it said.

<TITLE>DOME &lt;DMP> PLAN MAY FORCE SALE OF ENCOR STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's proposal to
restructure debt of more than 6.10 billion Canadian dlrs
includes provisions that may force the company to sell its 42
pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Inc>, Dome said in a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
    Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making
payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose
debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares.
    After the five years are up, "under certain circumstances
the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed," the company
said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs.
    Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell
the stock to pay down its debt.
    Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on
March 17, 1987, the company's filing said.
    As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in
principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the
filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in
early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.
    Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its
existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the
interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning
agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.
    "The company believes that the negotiation and
implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is
realistic and achievable," Dome said.
    "However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be
predicted at this time," it said.

<DATELINE>    CARACAS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. signed a
letter of intent with Agip Carbone and Arco Coal Co, a unit of
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> to exploit the coal deposits at
Guasare in western Zulia state, PDVSA officials said.
    The Carbozulia project will include open-pit mining of the
low sulphur content coal, as well as the construction of a
railroad and port facilities, at an estimated total cost of 500
mln dlrs.
    The Agip/Arco consortium will own 48 pct of Carbozulia,
while PDVSA will have 49 pct, with the remaining three pct to
be held by private investors.
    Carboulia President Luis Urdaneta said work will begin this
month on a preliminary test mine with a capacity of 500,000 mt
a year. A first shipment is scheduled to be ready by third
quarter 1987, he said.
    "The purpose of this trial shipment is to let potential
customers know about the quality of the Guasare coal," Urdaneta
said. Long-term plans call for Carbozulia to produce 6.5 mln mt
a year of by 1995, at which time coal exports are expected to
bring Venezuela some 200 mln dlrs a year.
    Agip Carbone President Francesco Coffrini said yesterday 60
pct of Carbozulia's coal will be exported to European markets.

<TITLE>DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial analysts say they are
pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
year.
        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley
Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander
said in an interview.
    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
with danger.
    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
should be stabilized at around current levels.
    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
agreed to cut its budget deficit.
    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
States.
    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
that any deficit reduction was better than none.
    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
from plunging further in world exchange markets.
    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.
    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
most vexing and persistent problems.
    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
federal budget.
    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,
said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that
would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."
    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now
look like a failure to Wall Street."
    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
anticipated spending levels for next year.
    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia's coffee export registrations
remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new
marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,
Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'
association said.
    "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close
registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told
Reuters.
    On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and
May for an unlimited amount.
    Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters
had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,
or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the
average in recent years.
    He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national
coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total
of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
Colombia.
    "The only change that could happen is, because of the
volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL'S CREDITORS MUST TRUST HIM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro, who suspended interest payments to creditor banks two
months ago, said creditors had to trust him when he said Brazil
would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue
servicing its debt.
    Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy, Funaro said
he would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outside
his country, but added, "At the same time we show credibility,
you (the banks) are going to have to trust us."
    Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancing
needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund, Funaro said, "What other options do
they have?...They have to try to see our program."
    Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the Interim
Committee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bank
and IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the
major creditor banks in New York yesterday.
    According to Funaro, the creditor banks "agreed on the need
to find a solution to the crisis." He did not elaborate.
    Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's need
for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that
Brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net
capital that it transferred over the past three years.
    He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs to
ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11
billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.
    Administration officials familiar with the negotiations
said Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense
based on current conditions in that country, and added that
they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.
    Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., told
Reuters he remains hopeful that Brazil and its foreign bank
creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the
end of the year.
    But Preston, who did not attend the meeting between Funaro
and creditor banks yesterday, added the onus is still on Brazil
to put its economic house in order first.
    "They haven't even come up with a plan yet," Preston said
after Morgan's annual meeting in New York today.
    Funaro, however, said most creditor banks had
representatives in Brazil who were well aware of Brazil's new
economic measures, designed to curb a surge in inflation and
spending and a sharp drop in exports.
    Funaro called Brazil's program very responsible and very
strong, adding that "it is very different from other years,
there has been a tremendous change."
    Based on Brazil's current economic situation - suspension
of interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks, 200 pct
inflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans every
year until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options.

<TITLE>MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By PATTI DOMM, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs
acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor
business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by
the tobacco company, analysts said.
     "They were very frustrated with their inability to get
Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It
doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one," said
Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.
    American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion
dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to
buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been
speculating that American Brands would find another candidate
to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
    "This is just typical," said George Thompson of
Prudential-Bache securities. "There's going to be more to come
here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because
tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position
is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,"
he said.
cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business
does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can
therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the
National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin
and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the
type of acquisition they envisioned.
    "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady
gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,"
said Thompson.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
protectionism and control on capital movements.
    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
determined market trends.
    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity," Koehler said.
    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
make itself felt compared with the price effect.
    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
over the medium term," Koehler said.
    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
rise faster than GNP.
    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.
    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
investment in the U.S.
    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.
    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
    "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a
spokesman told Reuters.
    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
farm talks.
    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
Control Act.
    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
justified, it said.
    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

<TITLE>N.Z. GOVERNMENT POPULARITY RISES AHEAD OF ELECTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Pritchett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's ruling Labour Party
government has just completed its three-year economic reform
which threw thousands of people out of work, yet its popularity
has risen as the September deadline for the election draws
closer, a recent poll shows.
    An Eyewitness/Heylen Poll, conducted for Television New
Zealand's Eyewitness news broadcast on April 2, showed Labour
had the support of 50 pct of voters compared with the
opposition National Party's 46 pct.
    The figures had been reversed in a poll a month earlier.
    The poll showed 40 pct of the canvassed voters thought the
economy would improve over the next year, up 12 points on last
month's result.
    The increase came in a week when the government turned
seven departments into nine profit-oriented corporations run by
businessmen who promptly sacked some 4,000 employees, including
half the country's 1,700 coal miners.
    The latest survey confounded those who proclaimed Labour's
days were numbered because of perceived insensitivity to its
traditional backers, the workers, political analysts said.
    The poll indicates people are swinging behind the party and
the arguments of Finance Minister Roger Douglas, who has
presided over the deregulation of the economy and the
construction of one based on market forces without subsidies or
currency controls, the analysts said.
    The economic reforms, by a party increasingly regarded in
New Zealand as more akin to the West European-style Social
Democrats than working class socialists, have rattled the
National Party, which is now regretting it was not as
innovative in the decade it ruled until Prime Minister Robert
Muldoon was ousted in 1983, one analyst said.
    The National Party was further shaken, the analyst said,
when the Press, a Christchurch daily, said on April 2 the party
was "on the verge of flying apart" with the prospect of a coup
attempt against leader Jim Bolger by Muldoon. Bolger said the
article was an April Fool's joke.
    Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong tax
revenues, a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing, an
improvement in the balance of payments, a reduction in foreign
debt and improved productivity, economists said.
    Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter ended
March 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year, they said.
    Labour's reforms have hit every sector, but the most
dramatic was the "corporatisation" of seven government
departments on April 1, which critics argue is the first stage
step towards the sale of state assets, the analysts said.
    The move stops short of privatisation, as the state will
retain ownership, but the new corporations are expected to be
financially self-supporting and pay dividends.
    Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility,
Electricorp, said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billion
dlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them.
    No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the
former forest service, the analysts added.
    Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service had
been losing 100 mln dlrs annually, yet due to economies it now
employed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the new
corporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mln
dlrs in its first year.
    Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as the
only shareholder, retaining the right to order the new
corporations to undertake certain projects although the full
cost must be met by the state, the analysts said.
    Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would
be held accountable for performance, with the government paying
for projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons.
    This policy has already caused problems, the analysts
added. For example, Electricorp has refused to spend several
hundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate,
further up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under
construction in Central Otago.
    Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs
had decided last year that Luggate be built and it was
important that the government honour its promises.
    "But it is also a matter of importance that we do not see
many more jobs lost because of economic distortion than we
would save by having that promise honoured to the last," he
added.

<TITLE>HOSPITAL CORP OF AMERICA &lt;HCA> GETS MERGER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hospital Corp of America said it
received a letter today from an investor group offering to buy
the company for 47 dlrs a share.
    Based on 82 mln outstanding shares, the offer is worth
about 3.85 billion dlrs. But the company said that it would
take more than five billion dlrs to consummate the merger and
retire certain company debt.
    It said it does not believe the offer is in the best
interest of shareholders, but added that it is referring the
matter to its board for discussions and would respond in due
course.
    Hospital Corp of America said the letter was sent by
Charles Miller and Richard Ragsdale, two former officers of
&lt;Republic Health Corp>, and Richard Scott, a partner in a
Dallas law firm.
    The investors' letter stated that based on discussions with
several major financial institutions they were confident
financing for the transaction could be arranged, Hospital Corp
of America said. But it said the letter did not indicate that
the investors had made arrangements to obtain financing.
    It said no further significant details were outlined in the
letter.
    Hospital Corp of America, a manager and owner of hospitals,
earned 174.6 mln dlrs or 2.08 dlrs a share, on revenues of 4.93
billion dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
they said.
    "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"
said one diplomatic source.
    "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source
said.
    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
said.
    "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
face the situation."
    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
monopolizes the business.
    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
its telecommunications market.
    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
telephone and satellite communications market.
    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
sector it regulates.
    "What has been happening is an important shift in the
economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said
James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
Service Inc.
    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
    "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
Whitten.
    Close links with the powerful political faction of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
analysts said.
    "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
the influential political group, he added.
    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
Postal Savings System, analysts said.
    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
banks, they said.
    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
the ministry as feudal.
    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
including Britain, several analysts said.
    "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.
"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
view," he said.

<TITLE>MEMBERS OF JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SHUN NAKASONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of prime minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned
his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.
    "His presence will do more harm than good," an LDP candidate
in Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of several
conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry
against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.
    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down
before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10
if the LDP lost too many major local seats.
    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his
party to its greatest-ever election victory last July, and
analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.
    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of
polling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.
    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the
governorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centre
parties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,
who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist
parties.
    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.
    "The LDP and the centrist parties should have about
1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the
incumbent and has the sales tax weapon," said Rei Shiratori,
professor of political science at Dokkyo University.
    "Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if
the LDP wins in Fukuoka," he said.
    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the
governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.
    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at Hosei
University, said, "Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if
the LDP loses only in Hokkaido."
    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales
tax proposal.
    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to
overhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36
years.
    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese
domestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax
revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating
the economy.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN SHARE MARKET CLOSES AT ALL-TIME HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Keen demand for gold stocks and quality
industrials pushed the Australian share market to all-time
highs in active trading, brokers said.
    A higher close on Wall Street, a strong local dollar and
easier domestic interest rates boosted sentiment in the
industrial sector, while demand for gold stocks continued
despite a slightly softer bullion price.
    Brokers said Western Mining featured in trading, gaining 30
cents to 9.00 dlrs after announcing a five-for-eight bonus
issue. By the close of trading, the all ordinaries index had
risen 12.5 points above yesterday's close to a record 1,771.6.
    The all industrials index gained 20.8 points to 2,639.3 and
the all resources 6.2 to 1,110.2. The gold index passed
yesterday's record close by 73.6 points to reach 3,156.2.
    National turnover was a high 206.7 mln shares worth 376.3
mln dlrs, with rises outnumbering falls five to three.
    Turnover was boosted by a large number of special sales,
including one for 5.0 mln Kalimantan Gold at 65 cents, 5.95 mln
Minora Resources at 23 cents, 3.57 mln Barrier Reef at 65, and
about 13 specials in Elders IXL totalling more than 2.0 mln
shares, brokers said. Elders rose 14 to 5.64 as more than 6.0
mln traded following news it will float Courage hotels.
    Elsewhere in the industrials sector, investors concentrated
on banking and insurance stocks and those in the food and
alcohol and tobacco sectors. ANZ gained 12 cents to 3.70 dlrs,
Westpac and National Australia four each to 5.06 and 5.64, and
FAI 10 to 10.60 after reaching a high of 10.90.
    Goodman Fielder advanced 10 to 4.60, Southern Farmers 20 to
8.40, and Arnotts 10 to 4.70. Amatil gained 10 to 10.70 and
Rothmans 20 to 7.20.
    Others to gain included Bell Group, up 15 to 10.85, IEL, 16
higher at 5.36, and Wormald, up 20 at 3.65. Coles Myer rose 20
to 7.00 after reports it plans to expand overseas.

<TITLE>G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

    First quarter volume also rose sharply, to 9.95 billion

    The record volume reflected increased investment in

<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is likely to succeed in joining
GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because
western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.
    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to
integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80
pct of world trade.
    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of
detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and
complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.
    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its
application supported by the United States, Japan and the
European Community for political and economic reasons.
    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw
back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.
    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.
    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the
Soviet Union," he said.
    "China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet
Union. GATT is not a political body."
    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,
including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.
    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and
promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.
    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish
the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state
and often contain subsidies.
    "Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try
to find out the real cost of something, officials do not give
you a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do
not want to answer," he said.
    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT in
February, is that it is gradually reforming its price system to
bring prices in line with real production costs and replace
administrative controls with market ones.
    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies
such as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, China
would not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as
a less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.
    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are
small, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.
    "It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, for
instance," the diplomat said. "It could have a very large impact
on world trade."
    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its
companies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for
vitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.
    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of
grain it exported, because it had to make up the difference
between a low world price and a high domestic price.
    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade
bureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies
might be as high as 100 pct for some products.
    "When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole
country, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding with
a grin that they would not tell me," he said.
    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of
the sensitivity of the subject.
    "Unless something is done to change this, China will find
many countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from
China," the diplomat added.
    In a major speech on the economy late last month, Planning
Minister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.
    "While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign
exchange, we must improve economic accounting practices and
reduce the cost of exports," he said.
    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign
trade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT
principles could conflict with domestic pressures. China has
said there will be no major price reforms this year following
widespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to
stable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.
    "So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China
reform its economy?," the diplomat said. "How can it balance the
requirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?"
    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the
end outweigh these problems.
    "China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a
part of the world economy," he said.
    "Just as China would get increased access to foreign
markets, so it would have to give more access to its domestic
market to foreign countries."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remarks by two leading central bankers
sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
the West German three pct discount rate may be under
discussion, currency dealers said.
    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
required cuts in interest rates.
    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
gained slight background support from the speculation.
    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity."
    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet trade deficit with the West
almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
    Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
pct.
    Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
to grow in 1986.
    Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
West.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L>, RTZ,
said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
    Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
    The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
    RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
oil prices.
    Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned
subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd
and RTZ Pillar Ltd. First time contributions from recent
investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
minerals also aided performance.
    Metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.

yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
Commission sources said.
    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
the sources said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
operators protesting that rebates are too low.
    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless
the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

<TITLE>CBOT SEES YEN BOND FUTURES LISTING IN SIX MONTHS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will
list yen bond futures contracts once the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission gives its approval, which could come within
six months, CBOT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said.
    Mahlmann earlier told a press conference he would visit
Kyoji Kitamura, director-general of the Finance Ministry's
Securities Bureau, to express the CBOT's concern that Japanese
financial institutions and individuals are not permitted to
trade on the CBOT. Mahlmann is on a two-week tour of Hong Kong,
Tokyo and Sydney.
    Mahlmann urged Japan to boost Tokyo's status as a world
financial center by promoting the internationalisation of its
financial industry.
    The Finance Ministry is expected to allow local banks,
securities houses and insurance companies to use overseas
markets from this month, bond market sources said, but
officials would only say the issue was under study.
    Initially, the ministry is likely to bar corporate and
individual investors due to their relative inexperience, and to
limit trading to instruments like currency, stock indexes, time
deposits and government debt futures, the sources said.
    Mahlmann told reporters the CBOT will start evening trading
to coincide with Far East morning activity on April 30. But he
added night sessions would not preclude the CBOT from forming
links with Far Eastern exchanges, although nothing had been
decided.
    Asked what type of financial futures would be appropriate,
he cited products concerning debt and equity.
    The CBOT evening session will run from 6:00 to 9:00 P.M.
Chicago time (2300 to 0200 GMT), which is 8:00 to 11:00 A.M. In
Tokyo, and trading will be limited to four contracts -- U.S.
Treasury note and bond futures and options, he said.
    Yen bond dealers said a proposed link between CBOT and the
London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE),
combined with yen bond futures listings on both, would multiply
volume if trade was encouraged by Tokyo-based orders.
    Healthy liquidity growth in cash yen bond markets overseas
is a prerequisite for expanded futures trading, traders said.
    LIFFE plans to list yen bond futures should go ahead from
September, possibly coinciding with the CBOT, traders said.
    The CBOT applied for permission to offer a long-term
Japanese government bond futures contract on March 17, and the
authorities must rule on the request within a year.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss
the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in
Washington, government officials said.
    Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to
secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very
seriously, said an official travelling with him.
    Britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions
on Japanese finance houses in London if Japan does not open up
its markets. The U.S. Has already imposed higher tariffs on
computer microchips imported from Japan.
    Michael Howard, the British minister for consumer and
corporate affairs, repeated the threat of sanctions before
leaving Tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during
which he failed to secure major concessions from the Japanese.
    Howe's main mission in Washington was to brief Shultz on
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union
last week. Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week.

<TITLE>G-7 COMMITMENT TESTS JAPAN'S WILL TO BOOST ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The statement issued today by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater
international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a
further rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.
    They said the communique reflected increased foreign
frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its
tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.
    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the
statement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the
yen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.
    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed
proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its
economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open
its domestic markets.
    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the
communique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, general
manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed how
strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and
effective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.
    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed
economic measures, such as early implementation of a large
supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    It did not mention any figure for the projected
supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it," Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo
said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."
    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
Stock Exchange.
    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
from which it was previously exempt.
    The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
the tax decision.
    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
in the country.
    In Manila item "Philippine Telephone firm plans stock split"
please read in page 3, first para, "the company's profits are
likely to be substantially cut" (inserting dropped word). This
replaces  "the company's profits are likely to be substantial"

<TITLE>MALAYSIA SEEKS 42 BILLION YEN PIPELINE LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia has asked Japan for a 42
billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas
pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor, the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said.
    OECF's chief representative, Takashi Matsuya, told
reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan.
Another OECF official told Reuters Japan is likely to approve
the loan because "it is technically and economically viable."
    If approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four
pct, a grace period of seven years, Matsuya said. It would be
disbursed over three years, he added.
    The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the
Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas, Malaysia's
national oil company.
    The first phase was the supply of gas to households in and
around the eastern oil town of Kertih.

<TITLE>CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Credit Commercial de France &lt;CCFP.PA>
reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
denationalisation around the end of this month.
    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,

planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
    The sources said it was too early to give details of the
planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
likely date for the flotation launch.
    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
ten shareholders before the flotation.
    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.
"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"
CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.
    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation
at between four and five billion francs.
    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least
the same number of investors as &lt;Sogenal>, another recently
privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.
    The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also
included the sale of Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere
de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA>. The sale of &lt;Banque du Batiment et des
Travaux Publics> and &lt;Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee>
should be completed this month, while third largest French bank
Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA> will be privatised later this year.

<DATELINE>c    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lex Service Plc &lt;LEXL.L> said it had
acquired &lt;Sears Motor Group Ltd>, the retail motor distribution
arm of Sears Plc &lt; SEHL.L>, and an 11.9 mln stg loan note
payable by Sears Motor for 33.4 mln stg.
    The purchase will be through 1.4 mln stg in cash and the
issue to Sears Plc of 8.0 mln new Lex ordinary shares.
    The company said in a statement that immediately following
the acquisition of the motor group, its car and commercial
vehicle contract hire fleet of some 3,000 vehicles was sold to
&lt;Lex Vehicle Leasing Ltd> for 14.3 mln stg in cash, a sum equal
to the net book value of the vehicles transferred.
    Lex Vehicle is owned equally by Lex Services and &lt;Lombard
North Central Plc>.
    Lex said the shares involved in the transaction were today
being placed for Sears Plc with institutions at 400p. These
shares will not qualify for the final Lex dividend on 10 April.
    Lex said in a statement that its acquisition of Sears Motor
Group represents a major development for its automotive
activities. The enlarged retailing operations of the Lex
Automotive group now have a turnover of 530 mln stg. Lex's
existing automotive interests include Volvo Concessionaires,
the sole importer of Volvo cars and parts into the U.K.
    Lex said the turnover for Sears Motor Group in the year to
31 December 1986 was 242 mln stg and that at the date of the
acquisition the group had about 50 mln stg in external
borrowings.
    Lex shares fell on the announcement to trade around 409p
from a 419p close yesterday.

<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines will import 250,000 bags
of cement worth 375,000 dlrs from Indonesia by the end of the
month to meet growing demand from the construction sector,
Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion said.
    He told reporters that local cement manufacturers had
stepped up production but were falling short of demand. "The
only solution is to import," he added.
    Concepcion said average monthly requirements of cement in
1986 were 6.7 mln bags while supply hovered around 9.3 mln
bags, but this year demand had grown to 10.4 mln bags per
month.
    Trade and Industry sources said construction sector
representatives estimated an additional 70,000 bags would be
required daily to meet demand.
    Cement is officially priced at 48.50 pesos per bag, but
construction industry sources said it was selling at black
market rates of up to 65 pesos a bag in some areas.
    The sources said falling interest rates as well as a
government budget of four billion pesos in 1987 for low-cost
housing had fuelled a construction boom.

<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to
discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and
ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.
    The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the
four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.
    This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a
meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not
be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber
exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading
centre.
    The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and
contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be
discussed.
    Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries
adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva.
The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its
predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing
the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.

of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
opened, dealers said.
    Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
    The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
levels reflect economic fundamentals.
    One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.

<TITLE>JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan, which has been accused of dumping
everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,
is now under attack for alleged cut-throat selling of a product
of a different sort -- banking services.
    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials
pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that
foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair
advantage in world financial markets.
    The technical banking talks coincided with, but were
separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left
Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.
    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various
countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must
put up to back up their loans.
    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the
bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what
else should be included.
    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can
undercut them on loans and other banking services because
Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.
    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,
head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "They
see us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catch
up with them."
    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to
adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital
equivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two
countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.
    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little
hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new
regulations governing capital ratios last May.
    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a
capital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of
overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for
Japanese banks with overseas branches.
    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's
banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of
Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.
    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have
capital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are
well above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking
climb of Tokyo share prices.
    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too
high by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to
realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell
the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.
    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying
that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show
that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.
    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.
Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up
applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial
institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of
their hidden reserves.
    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the
Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks
on the subject.

<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Netherlands' largest insurer
Nationale Nederlanden NV &lt;NTTN.AS> (NatNed) said it expected at
least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net
profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in
1985,
    Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders
after 17.27 billion the previous year, and the dividend was
raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985,
corrected on a capital increase.
    The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured
by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and
Australian dollar and sterling.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have
been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,
NatNed said.
    The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986
compared with 52 pct in 1985.
    The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln
guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences,
tighter interest margins and increased investment.
    Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the
previous year.
    The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders
in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.
    Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss
the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in
Washington, government officials said.
    Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to
secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very
seriously, said an official travelling with him.
    Britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions
on Japanese finance houses in London if Japan does not open up
its markets. The U.S. Has already imposed higher tariffs on
computer microchips imported from Japan.
    Michael Howard, the British minister for consumer and
corporate affairs, repeated the threat of sanctions before
leaving Tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during
which he failed to secure major concessions from the Japanese.
    Howe's main mission in Washington was to brief Shultz on
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union
last week. Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
near term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.
    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
should not have produced disappointment.
    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."
    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent
remedy?" he asked.
    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
support the Paris accord.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
with banks.
    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

<TITLE>SWEDISH DRUG FIRM ASTRA RISE ON AIDS HOPES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish drug firm AB Astra &lt;ASTS.ST>
shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading
on the Stockholm Bourse, amid hopes its research into
anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    Stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy
institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic
assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which
was released this week.
    Brokers Enskilda Fondkommission said in a report this month
that Astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.
    Although Enskilda said Astra had not made any breakthrough
in developing a specific drug to treat the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome it noted that investors were only now
discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.
    "It is clear that Astra has a tradition in anti-viral
research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease,"
the report by Enskilda, the investment banking unit of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken &lt;SEBS.ST>, said.
    Company officials could not be reached for comment on the
causes of today's share rise.

<TITLE>EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community launched an
investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
an intensification of world trade strains.
    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
imports into the U.S.
    The EC Executive Commission said today the European
Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
order to compete with the Japanese.
    The Commission said it believed the Association had given
sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
the complaints were justified.
    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.
And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged
access to the Japanese market.

<TITLE>FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance ministers from seven major
industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
boost their economy.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
    The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed
the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."
    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including
an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works
expenditures."
    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
then-current levels.
    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
around postwar lows.
    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
exports.
    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate.
    It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

<TITLE>AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

<TITLE>G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
market of their resolve.
    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
totally new statement was needed.
    The speculative selling did not reflect economic
fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
said.
    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
mark, had remained stable.
    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.
    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
Miyazawa said.
    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
major currencies largely have been stable.
    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
period since the Paris agreement.
    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

<TITLE>YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The yen is likely to start another
uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies
because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,
currency and bond analysts here said.
    "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said
one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.
    Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The
market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."
    The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days
just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying
bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting
of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven
industrialized nations in Washington.
    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a
communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's
view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent
with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability
should be fostered around these levels.
    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.
    "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line
when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked
Republic's Cohen.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled
speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are
prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is
still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.
    Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the
key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the
authorities' permissible range.
    Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would
probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop
up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market
intervention and public comments.
    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of
Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of
dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.
    The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively
selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade
data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion
dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

<TITLE>G-7 COMMITMENT TESTS JAPAN'S WILL TO BOOST ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The statement issued today by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater
international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a
further rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.
    They said the communique reflected increased foreign
frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its
tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.
    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the
statement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the
yen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.
    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed
proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its
economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open
its domestic markets.
    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the
communique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, general
manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed how
strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and
effective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.
    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed
economic measures, such as early implementation of a large
supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    It did not mention any figure for the projected
supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it," Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
long term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.

developer SAPC Inc said it has filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Boston against Lotus Development Corp, alleging the
infringement of a copyright and the misappropriation of trade
secrets and is seeking 100 mln dlrs in damages.
    The firm's suit alleges that Lotus' spreadsheet program
1-2-3 violates the copyright of VisiCalc, which was developed
by SAPC several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, when
the firm was known as Software Arts Inc.  Software Arts sold
rights to VisiCalc to Lotus in 1985 and changed its name.
    The suit also alleges that Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor,
who resigned as chairman in July 1986, breached a
confidentiality agreement with SAPC.  Kapor, also named as a
defendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights to
VisiCalc before founding Lotus.
    The suit alleges that Lotus and Kapor deliberately sought
to make 1-2-3 look and feel like VisiCalc by copying a number
of commands, keystrokes and screen displays.
    Lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States, which has long
sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
to stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
meetings of leading industrial nations.
    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
foster exchange rate stability.
    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
years.
    Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary
Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the
light of the Japanese announcement.
    They also said there was a growing feeling among the
finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
differences in past meetings.
    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
trade deficit have already taken place.
    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
reafffirmation of Paris.
    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
    The United States and France, backed by the International
Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
account balances.
    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
consultations between the countries on whether corrective
action should be required.
    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
relatively free currency markets of recent years.

<TITLE>FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
    "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.
    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>EC SHELVES LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THREE AIRLINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community Commission said
today it has shelved threatened legal action against West
Germany's Lufthansa &lt;LHAG.F>, Alitalia of Italy &lt;AERI.MI> and
Olympic Airways of Greece after they agreed to change practices
that restrict competition in the heavily-protected EC sector.
    The Commission had also written to seven other Community
airlines, including British Airways &lt;BAB.L> and Air France,
last summer warning them that agreements such as capacity and
revenue sharing accords broke EC competition rules. The seven
have already agreed to hold talks with the Commission on
bringing such practices into line with the rules.
    In a statement, the EC's executive authority also spelled
out tough demands it will be putting to carriers in talks on
liberalising EC air transport and bringing down airfares,
warning that new legal moves were possible if they refused to
comply.
    As a first step, the Commission wanted the 10 carriers to
eliminate the most serious distortions of competition caused by
the current practices and agreements.
    The latest demands go further towards liberalisation than
proposals that are currently the subject of difficult
negotiations between by EC Transport Ministers. REUTER

<TITLE>INDIAN STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's private businessmen say they
have been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from
the capital market because government companies are wooing
investors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.
    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although
equity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms
provide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast
losing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth
and income taxes.
    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into
government company bonds because of their tax-free status and
easy transferability.
    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue
equity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal
1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public
sector bonds, a merchant banker said.
    They included equity shares and rights issue worth one
billion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata
Fertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed
indefinitely.
    "The government bonds are making serious inroads on the
private sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka,
president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry.
    "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with
and equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise
resources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.
    A senior Finance Ministry official said government and
private firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding
it was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were
preventing private firms from raising money on the stock
market.
    "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies
still account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in
stock exchanges," the ministry official said.
    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani
said government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or
about 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and
non-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.
    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees
mobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks,
mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing
their surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.
    "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the
bonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going
for equities or debentures floated by private companies on a
selective basis," the spokesman said.
    The maturity period of government company bonds varies
between seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes are
payable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct
interest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^M
exceeds 7,000 rupees a year.
    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and
12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private
companies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from
the tax on income earned from them.
    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on
India's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely on
the stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can
only be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.
    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in
the stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax
concessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.
    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first
government company to issue the bonds to raise one billion
rupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private
companies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was
oversubscribed three times, brokers said.
    Official figures show bonds floated by government companies
have been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have
sought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming
months.
    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51
billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the
Finance Ministry.
    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees
last year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the
Indian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription
totalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.
    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to
maintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.
    Goenka said that government bonds are making it
increasingly difficult for private companies to launch new
equity or debenture issues. He said the government could at
least "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through
such bonds by the public sector."
    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state
companies to borrow from the public by reducing financial
support to them.
    To ease its internal debt burden, the government has
reduced the budgetary support to development investment in
about 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in
1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures
show.

groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.

<TITLE>PHYSIO TECHNOLOGY &lt;PHYT> SEES LOSS, IN DEFAULT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOPEKA, Kan., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Physio Technology Inc said it
expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about
200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
    The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
    It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
chief executive officer.
    Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
    It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
    The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
the end of any 30 day period.
    Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
"significantly reduce its fixed overhead."
    Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
affected by the move.
    The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue
to serve as a director, it added.

open unchanged to slightly lower this morning with support near
yesterday's lows.
    Crude futures are called unchanged to five cts weaker
tracking unchanged domestic crudes and North Sea Brent crude,
which traded at 18.01 dlrs a barrel today, about ten cts below
yesterday's New York close.
    Traders said the supply squeeze in 15-day forward April
Brent appears to have ended.
    Product futures, which fell sharply yesterday, are due to
open unchanged to 0.25 cent lower, traders said.
    Traders expect some followthrough selling in products but
said gasoil futures in London will probably lend some support
since they are trading as expected. May gasoil futures were off
1.50 dlrs a tonne this morning while June was down 1.25 dlrs in
thin conditions.

<TITLE>CHINA LIKELY TO JOIN GATT, DIPLOMATS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is likely to succeed in joining
GATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because
western countries support its entry, western diplomats said.
    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to
integrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80
pct of world trade.
    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of
detailed questions to China next month at the start of long and
complex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.
    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its
application supported by the United States, Japan and the
European Community for political and economic reasons.
    "The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw
back the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was," he said.
    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.
    "If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the
Soviet Union," he said. "China's agreement will be seen as a
model for the Soviet Union. GATT is not a political body."
    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,
including China's pricing system and trade subsidies.
    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and
promote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.
    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish
the real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state
and often contain subsidies.

There was more demand and less on offer in the market," one
dealer told Reuters.
    The pound, which was at 18 to the dollar in January, 1986,
has lost more than 30 pct of its international value over the
past three months.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/SEMICONDUCTOR BOOK TO BILL RATIO</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Semiconductor Industry
Association is expected to report the sixth straight increase
in its three-month average book-to-bill ratio, reflecting a
continued modest recovery in the computer chip industry,
semiconductor analysts said.
    Semiconductor analysts contacted by Reuters put the March
book-to-bill -- which is the ratio of new orders to actual
sales -- at around 1.15, up from a preliminary 1.13 in the
three months ended in February. The association is expected to
release its estimates later today or on friday.
    The analysts said they expect strong March performance both
in new orders and actual sales.
    Michael Gumport, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc,
projected the three-month average of new computer chip orders
at about 835 mln dlrs, up from 788 mln dlrs in February.
    He put three-month average sales at about 720 mln dlrs,
also an increase from the 700 mln dlrs reported last month.
    Gumport said average new orders over 850 mln dlrs would be
a plus for semiconductor industry stocks, while orders under
800 would be interpreted negatively on Wall Street.
    Gumport said cut backs in Japanese computer chip production
are aiding U.S. chip maker orders and sales.
    Edward White, analyst with E.F. Hutton Group Inc, said
while Japanese cut backs may be a small factor, their effect
should be more readily apparant in April and May.
    White, who put the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.15-1.16,
said the ratio might hit 1.20 later this spring, before showing
a normal seasonal decline during the summer.
    He forecast three-month average orders at 825 mln dlrs for
March, with three-month average billings at about 711 mln dlrs.
    "This says the industry is still in a phase of moderate
recovery...it is not dramatic yet," said White.
    He said the industry still has not seen a pick-up in high
technology capital spending needed to create a strong recovery.
    He said a boost in spending on such big-ticket items as
mainframe computers would enhance the recovery, which is now
focused on personal and small business computers.
    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak agreed the
industry is showing a recovery trend, that while encouraging,
is not dramatic.
    Kubiak projected the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.14. He
said the three-month average for orders will be up about 4.5
pct from last month, while shipments rise about one pct.
    He noted, however, orders during the month of March alone,
a statistic the Semiconductor Industry Association does not
publish, should show a 15-20 pct rise from February orders.
    Kubiak said a book to bill ratio of 1.14 would have little
or no effect on semincondutor industry stocks, while a ratio of
1.13 would be negative for the market and a ratio of 1.16 would
likely cause the stocks to rise.

<TITLE>LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moderately active grain fixing was
reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
said.
    A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
dlrs.
    Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
    Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
was obtainable.
    On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
paid 22 dlrs.
    Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and
secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round
trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from
Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.

<TITLE>EUROCHEQUE EXPECTS AROUND 10 PCT CARD GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The number of cards in the Eurocheque
system, Europe's biggest personal payments system, grew by 11
pct to 39.1 mln last year and is expected to continue
increasing by around 10 pct in coming years, Eurocheque
International Secretary General Mark Van Wauve said.
    He told a news conference Eurocheque cards can now be used
in 40 European and Mediterranean countries to back Eurocheques
written in local currency and, where facilities are available,
as electronic debit cards. The system would have 5,000
automatic cash dispensers by the end of this year and aimed to
have 25,000 throughout Europe by 1992.
    Eurocheques and cards are issued by banks in 21 countries.
    Van Wauve said Italian banks, who already accept
Eurocheques, had recently asked to be allowed also to issue
Eurocheques and cards to their clients. It was possible these
would be launched in Italy this year if the Rome government
agreed to lift exchange controls that prevent residents writing
cheques abroad in any currency but lira, he told Reuters.
    Eurocheque International, the system's Brussels-based
coordinating centre, was also reviewing a request from the
Soviet Union for permission to issue cheques and cards.
    Eurocheque's agreements with banks do not permit them to
charge commissions from clients using Eurocheques, and Van
Wauwe said problems with French banks that have demanded such
commissions had been reduced to a minimum last year.
    Eurocheques can also be used to pay in local currency for
goods and services bought in over five mln retail outlets in 28
countries, with Hungary, Tunisia and Greece added to the system
this year. East Germany last year became the 40th country to
accept Eurocheques, made out in dollars, at banks and shops.
    Eurocheque International estimated the total of Eurocheques
used nationally and internationally at over one billion a year.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
"subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    "Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded," he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable."
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

emphasised the need for structural adjustment and reform to the
economy, battered by five years of separatist disturbances.
    Officials said Sri Lanka's budget deficit this year is
expected to surpass the projected 28.7 billion rupees while
defence spending, already up by two billion rupees from a
targetted 10 billion, is also likely grow.
    The Ministry said de Mel asked the World Bank to give Sri
Lanka 6.5 billion rupees balance of payments support.

<DATELINE>    Milan, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Holding company &lt;Gemina Spa> said it had
no comment on an Italian press report today that it has
acquired a 12 pct stake in &lt;Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano Spa>.
    Italian daily La Repubblica said that Gemina paid 205
billion lire for the shareholding from several Italian banks. A
Gemina spokeswoman told Reuters, "We have nothing to say about
the report."
    A spokeswoman for Milan-based Ambrosiano said, "We have no

<TITLE>U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States, which has long
sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
to stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far
East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point
despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.
    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the
movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading
ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.
    "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.
    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
meetings of leading industrial nations.
    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
foster exchange rate stability.
    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
years. Monetary sources also said they understood that
Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely
successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.
    They also said there was a growing feeling among the
finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
differences in past meetings.
    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
trade deficit have already taken place.
    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
reafffirmation of Paris.
    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
    The United States and France, backed by the International
Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
account balances.
    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
consultations between the countries on whether corrective
action should be required.
    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
relatively free currency markets of recent years.

<TITLE>GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The global economy is expected to
weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
additional concern.
    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
pct from 3.5 pct last year.
    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
with growing mounds of debt.
    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
states for markets for their products as well as financial
assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
economies poses fundamental worries.
    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
including the key one of exports.
    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
deficit.
    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
slower than expected.
    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has
to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
to get a resonably complete effect."
    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even
more time on this occasion."

<TITLE>SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The head of Spain's employers'
federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
about the government's monetary policies because high real
interest rates were hampering investment.
    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
11.8 at end-1986.
    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
pct wage ceiling.
    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
increase over the corresponding period last year.
    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
peseta to correct the imbalance.

<TITLE>LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donald Bradshaw, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lead prices have risen this week against
a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders
said.
    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying
or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.
    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at
a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and
prices tending to drift lower.
    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low
level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical
demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.
    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be
felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,
stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders
said.
    The lower supply levels result from a number of different
factors around the globe.
    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries
because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish
exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at
Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant
additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have
been drawing on LME stocks.
    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,
South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks
for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet
commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.
    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes
per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks
and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the
U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and
a regular supplier to the world market.
    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,
have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.
    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up
quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported
in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the
first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying
order was filled by merchants in March.
    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices
this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and
establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months
delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in
Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often
a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.
    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp
and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,
and this is believed to be in strong hands.
    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest
level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses
which are not popular with merchants putting together
shipments.
    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since
the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to
secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies
affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on
the transport of used batteries.
    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important
part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts
expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,
Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.
    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract
expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of
strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.
    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting
speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current
firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium
to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at
midsession.

billion from 964 mln dlrs.
    Domestic sales of 604 mln dlrs were unchanged and foreign
sales, expressed in dlrs, increased 11.4 pct from the year
earlier period. If foreign exchange rates were constant,
foreign sales would have decreased 1.0 pct and total sales 0.4
pct, the company said.
    "As anticipated, March sales were lackluster in our
seasonally sensitive businesses due to Easter's being three
weeks later this year than last," the company said in a
statement.

Tuesday to discuss measures to cover the state Social Security
Fund's deficit before the summer, Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac's social affairs adviser, Marie-Helene Berard, said.
    Employment Ministry officials say the fund, in surplus
until 1985, faces a 24 billion franc deficit by the end of this
year, largely because of rising unemployment. Budget Minister
Alain Juppe said the fund needed more resources and a
management overhaul. The government was not in favour of
introducing an additional tax to fund the deficit as did the 
previous socialist administration between 1982 and 1985, he
said.

<TITLE>E.F. HUTTON &lt;EFH> UNIT'S PUROLATOR OFFER EXPIRES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc said the tender
offer by its wholly owned unit, PC Acquisition Inc, for
Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC> expired at 2400 EDT yesterday
without the purchase of any Purolator common stock.
    Hutton added that PC Acquisition also terminated its merger
agreement with Purolator.
    Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the
tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about
two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because
the minimum number of shares was not tendered.
    Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC
Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.
Hutton, and some officers of Purolator's U.S. courier division,
in which PC offered to purchase 6,332,471 Purolator common
stock shares for 35 dlrs a share.
    Following that move, PC Acquisition planned to merge a
subsidiary into Purolator, converting all outstanding Purolator
common it did not own into an aggregate 46 mln dlrs principal
amount of 12 pct guaranteed debentures due 2002 and warrants to
purchase 15 pct of a Purolator unit comprised of Purolator's
U.S courier operations.
    Hutton said as of 2400 EDT yesterday about 181,000 shares
of Purolator common stock, or about 2.4 pct of the outstanding
shares, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn.
    PC Acquisition has instructed its depository for the offer
to return promptly the Purolator stock deposited by, or on
behalf of, tendering shareholders, Hutton said.

<TITLE>INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's national foodgrain target has
been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
annual report for 1986/87.
    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
sub-divisions of the country.
    The report gave the targets for various crops with
estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
mln.
   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
development plan ending March 31, 1990.
    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
good weather, the report said.
    "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
vigrously pursued," it said.

<TITLE>REICHHOLD CHEMICAL &lt;RCI> SETS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WHITE PLAINS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
common share outstanding.
    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
shares.
    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
specific takeover attempt.
    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
share of the company's common stock.
    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
connection with certain transactions afterward.
    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,
1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.
    Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed
to stockholders.

surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in
January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank
of Spain figures show.
    Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared
with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil
imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159
mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.
    Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with
February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last
February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.
    Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with
1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large
ammount of investment goods entering the country with the
recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.
    Spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655
mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and
502 mln dlrs in February last year.

<TITLE>UK, FRANCE TO URGE DEBT RELIEF FOR POOREST LANDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain, France and other European
nations will make a strong plea in high-level meetings today
for urgent debt relief for the very poorest countries, European
monetary sources said.
    The request will be put to the International Monetary
Fund's policy-making Interim Committee, which meets here as
part of semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.
    But it is likely to run into opposition from the United
States, which regards debt relief, even for the world's poorest
nations in Sub-Saharan Africa, with distaste.
    "If all creditors agreed, (Britain and France) would be
prepared to consider below market interest rates " for the
countries, one source said.
    A senior U.S. Treasury official poured cold water on the
plan earlier this week, however. "We are not willing to enter
into arrangements that would forgive debt or provide
concessional interest rates," the official said.
    At the heart of the American objection is the fear that
once such a concession is made for the very poorest nations,
then sooner or later Latin debtors will be demanding similar
relief.
    African nations owe foreign creditors, most of them
governments, over 70 billion dlrs. Over 21 billion dlrs is debt
owed by poorest Sub-Saharan African nations.
    In addition to interest rate concessions, the sources said
European countries wanted repayment of these loans to be
stretched out for up to 20 years, with a substantial delay
before capital repayments start.
    The issue was inconclusively discussed in yesterday's
meetings of the major industrial nations -- the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    It is already under consideration by the Paris Club of
western creditor nations, to which the United States belongs.
    "There are quite obviously differences about it," one source
said of the American attitude. "But it is perfectly clear that
(debt repayment) is an abiding problem for a small number of
the poorest countries."
    The plan would also involve the conversion of bilateral aid
to these countries into outright grants, a policy already
adopted by Paris and London.

<TITLE>VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Losses for Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

    It said the imports will be used to rebuild the federal

surcharges.

<TITLE>AMR &lt;AMR> UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp, the parent of American
Airlines, rose sharply in active trading after analyst Roland
Moreno of Smith Barney upgraded his opinion of the stock to buy
from accumulate and added it to the brokerage house's
recommended list, traders said.
    AMR climbed 1-3/8 to 55-5/8.
    A spokeswoman for Smith Barney said the recommendation was
made because the airline group looks cheap relative to the
broad market and the analyst feels AMR is the best in the
group.
    In a related action, Moreno downgraded his opinion of UAL
Inc &lt;UAL> to accumulate from buy and took it off the firm's
recommended list, Smith Barney's spokeswoman said. The stock
slipped 1/2 to 71-1/2 on volume of 1.3 mln shares.
    She said the Moreno's downgrade of UAL was because the
"stock had risen to a level beyond what current fundamentals
can support." The stock has risen more on merger speculation
than on fundamentals, the opinion continued.
    In recent weeks, rumors UAL stock was being accumulated for
a possible takeover bid shored up the stock, traders and
analysts said. In addition, pilots of UAL's United Airlines
unit proposed a buyout of the airline for 4.5 billion dlrs.
    The Smith Barney spokeswoman said the postive
recommendation of AMR emphasizes the company's strong marketing
ability, its good management and customer loyalty to the AMR
name. She said the company has been the best financial
performer of the airline group.
    The AMR recommendation includes earnings expectations of
4.35 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to earnings of 4.63 dlrs
a share last year, the spokeswoman said. In 1988, the company
is expected to earn six dlrs a share.
    Traders said other airline stocks moved higher today
primarily as a result of fare hikes announced Wednesday by
Texas Air &lt;TEX>, United Airlines and AMR.
    Delta &lt;DAL> rose 1/2 to 56-7/8, NWA Inc &lt;NWA> 3/8 to 66,
and Pan Am &lt;PN> 1/8 to 4-5/8.

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Computer Systems Inc
expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the
company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first
quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
revenues."
    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken
steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to
increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
discontinuance of products last year.
    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will
be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
shares outstanding.
    The company said the next three consecutive quarters should
demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
central banks would continue to intervene "as and when
necessary."
    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
speech to the British Parliament.
    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
still a risk," he said.
    Asked if the United States should consider increasing
interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a
need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
be a rise in interest rates in the United States."
    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
reducing its budget deficit.
    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
continue year after year," Lawson said.
    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been
no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."
    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
... but one has to be vigilant."
    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the
same thing," he said.
    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
weakness for that agreement.
    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
domestic demand.
    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
the second half of this year.

<TITLE>U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trading on the London potato futures
market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the
London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement
to floor members.
    It was in response to strong representations by the Potato
Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of
price which they say will result in large deliveries into the
physical market when the April futures position expires.
    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures
trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the
relationship between futures and physicals.
    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering
of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations
by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the
International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other
parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.
    The main complaint from some sections of the physical
market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over
the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this
morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's
average price of 104 stg.
    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is
a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality
potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying
between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser
quality grades have traded below 100 stg.
    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered
against the April futures contract between now and the end of
the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.
    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management
committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice
and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.

<TITLE>DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar drifted down to end one
pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
    Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
attempts to push it lower through the day.
    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
as "soft as wax."
    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
current reason to change monetary course at present.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may be under consideration.
    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
pct after 3.80 yesterday.
    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
    EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

may downgrade American Healthcare Management Inc's 80 mln dlrs
of 15 pct subordinated notes.
    Moody's review will focus on prospects for the company's
operating earnings in view of moderately disappointing results
in 1986, an increasingly difficult industry environment and the
possible loss later this year of income from one of American
Healthcare's most profitable hospitals.
    The agency said American was unable to renew that
hospital's lease. Moody's will also study the likelihood of
American Healthcare reducing debt service requirements.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Steel stocks, which have had a healthy
runup recently, still present some short term investment
opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
soon. They recommend taking profits.
    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said
Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be
strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
(order rates) are starting to dive already."
    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees
some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp
&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel
Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.
    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the
short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
rising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,
however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
make them more efficient.
    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to
recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford
noted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
they've come a long way," he said.
    "We think the stock will do moderately better than the
market," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
against losses last year.
    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
said.
    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy
on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
it," he said.
    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot
depends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales
come from oil and natural gas.
    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of
Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot
(of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
for," she said.
    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was
trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a
share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
1986.
    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has
been recommending the stocks since last November.
    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group
although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
third quarter.
    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)
prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"
he said.
    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal
dropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than
negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

<TITLE>BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in
a field report.
    The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on
an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
    The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
    Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains
in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have
affected quality, the report said.
    Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and
slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of
fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>US Sprint, a joint venture of
GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>, said its
second transcontinental fiber-optic route now is fully
operational.
    "The cable placement was completed in mid-March abd
commercial traffic began moving on the route April 1," Charles

    The new Southern route network runs from Los Angeles to

    The company also said its customer base now exceeds five

<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, APRIL 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian cocoa exporters are not
likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
boost world prices, trade sources said.
    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
    "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
    The traders were responding to questions whether they would
follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
criteria.
    "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
imbalances to more sustainable levels.
    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies
within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."
    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been
orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
external imbalances to more sustainable levels."
    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.
    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong
domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely
with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he
said.
    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
fall.
    "We should pay particular attention to the lack of
continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF
and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
temporary," he said.

    Iraq said today it repelled an Iranian assault near its
southern port of Basra last night, inflicting thousands of
casualties on the attackers.
    An Iraqi field commander told a correspondent of the
official Iraqi news agency INA that four Iranian divisions were
destroyed in the fighting. He said "Our forces are still engaged
in repelling the enemy offensive, inflicting on them intensive
losses, but (they are) in full control of the situation."
    A Baghdad war communique last night said Iraq had foiled a
three-pronged thrust some 10 km from Basra while admitting Iran
had occupied some fresh territory.

revenues in the budget plan by Congressional Democrats.
    "We believe that significant increases in taxes would not
reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth,"
Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee.
    He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of
gradually reducing deficits through restraining government
spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting
the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.

<TITLE>JAPAN CRITICISED FOR "DUMPING" OF BANK SERVICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan, which has been accused of dumping
everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,
is now under attack for alleged cutthroat selling of a product
of a different sort -- banking services.
    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials
pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that
foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair
advantage in world financial markets.
    The technical banking talks coincided with, but were
separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left
Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.
    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various
countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must
put up to back up their loans.
    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the
bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what
else should be included.
    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can
undercut them on loans and other banking services because
Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.
    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,
head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, "They
see us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catch
up with them."
    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to
adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital
equivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two
countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.
    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little
hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new
regulations governing capital ratios last May.
    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a
capital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of
overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for
Japanese banks with overseas branches.
    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's
banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of
Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.
    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have
capital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are
well above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking
climb of Tokyo share prices.
    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too
high by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to
realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell
the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.
    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying
that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show
that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.
    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.
Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up
applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial
institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of
their hidden reserves.
    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the
Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks
on the subject.

<TITLE>NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR> SEES SECOND QTR GAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
    National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
of orders.
    "I think the sales price was higher than most people
expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
    A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
    "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.
    National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
    Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
businesses.
    Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
    For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
67 cts per share.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LLOYD'S OFFERS CASH IN BID TO END PCW AFFAIR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lloyd's of London has offered to meet
part of the 235 mln stg in claims that investors in PCW
Underwriting Agencies face due to fraud and mismanagement,
chairman Peter Miller said at a press conference.
    Miller urged 3,000 PCW members to accept the offer so that
the five-year-old affair could be closed.
    The members have until May 30 to accept the offer,
involving a 103 mln stg payment by Lloyd's and some of Lloyd's
underwriters in exchange for a 34 mln stg contribution from PCW
members, he said.
    Miller said that at end-1985, PCW syndicates had gross
liabilities of 680 mln stg.
    To offset this, they had assets, including cash and
payments from reinsurance policies on some of the risks
underwritten by the syndicates, of 445 mln stg, leaving net
liabilities of 235 mln, he said.
    The total sum on offer, including a 48 mln stg payment from
Lloyd's 311 mln stg contingency fund and 55 mln stg from
Lloyd's brokers who could otherwise face court cases for their
involvement in PCW, is designed to cover the full reinsurance
cost for those 235 mln stg of net liabilities, Miller said.
    Under the offer, which requires 90 pct acceptance, Lloyd's
itself would take over all members' future obligations
connected with the PCW syndicates, Miller said. Members would
have to agree not to pursue the matter in court.
    Miller said a rejection of the offer would probably lead to
protracted litigation in court which, even if succesful for
members, was unlikely to produce a better deal for them.
    He added that acceptance would mean members could continue
underwriting in the Lloyd's market and qualify for tax relief
on the cash payments they would make towards the settlement.
    Miller denied that PCW members would face bills of over
200,000 stg.
    He said only 34 members would be asked to pay between
100,000 and 200,000 stg, and about 100 between 60,000 and
100,000 stg. Special arrangements would be sought for those who
accept the offer but are unable to pay.
    Miller said the offer did not imply Lloyd's accepted
responsibility for the affair, uncovered in the late autumn of
1982 when "it became quite clear that (PCW agency founder) Peter
Cameron Webb and (his partner) Peter Dixon had perpetrated
theft upon members," he said.
    Part of the sum involved was subsequently recovered and
repaid to members, but Cameron Webb and Dixon left the affairs
of PCW syndicates "in a state of chaos which led to a sharp
deterioration of their underwriting results," Miller said. Both
were fined by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee and expelled
from membership.
    He said Lloyd's would continue to seek reparation in
British and U.S. Courts "with the utmost vigour ... To bring to
a close one of the most shameful episodes in the history of
Lloyd's," and was contemplating claiming the full amount of the
settlement now on offer from Cameron Webb and Dixon.
    In a reaction, insurance brokerage Sedgwick Group Plc
&lt;SDWK.L> said it supported Lloyd's proposals and had
contributed 10 mln stg towards the proposed settlement.
    It said in a statement, "as largest broker in the Lloyd's
market, the company has an essential interest in maintaining
the reputation of the market. That reputation has been damaged
by problems at PCW and will continue to be so as long as they
remain unresolved." It had contributed to the proposed
settlement to avoid costs related to the defence of some of its
subsidiaries which had been named as potential defendants to
litigation by PCW members, it said.

<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Interstate Bancorp said it
signed franchise agreements with banks in Louisiana and
Washington D.C.
    The banks, Citizens Bank and Trust Co of Thibodaux,
Louisiana and National Enterprise Bank of Washington, will
change their names to First Interstate this summer.
    Citizens Bank has assets of 267 mln dlrs in eight offices.
National Enterprise has 53 mln dlrs in assets in one office.
    Under its franchise system, member banks offer a variety of
First Interstate financial services, but are not owned by First
Interstate.
    First Interstate operates 24 banks in 12 states, but its
franchise operation extends the geographic area through its
affiliate banks to 19 states, plus the District of Columbia.
    First Interstate, the nation's ninth largest bank, has 42
banks with 138 offices under its franchise system.
    Today's move is its first into the east coast and southern
portion of the nation. Most of its other franchise system banks
are located in the western region.
    First Interstate Chairman Joseph Pinola told Reuters in a
recent interview the lagging agricultural economy in the
Midwest continues to inhibit expansion into that region.

&lt;AVMD.PA> has offered the French Defence Ministry a new design
of its Rafale fighter which is lighter and less detectible by
radar, a company spokesman said today.
    The new version would weigh between 8.5 and nine tonnes
unarmed against 9.5 tonnes for the existing Rafale-A
demonstrator which first flew last year, he said.
    The Rafale-D design calls for special paints and materials
to absorb radar signals, as well as smoother contours and
electronic counter-measures.

<TITLE>WALL ST. SCANDAL SAID TO REFLECT REAGAN ETHIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A key U.S. lawmaker in the securities
field said the insider trading scandal gripping Wall Street
reflects the attitude of the Reagan administration.
    "They don't ask the question, 'Is it right or is it wrong?'
They ask the question, 'Can you pull it off?'" Rep Edward Markey
(D-Mass) told a state securities administrators meeting here.
    Markey, Chairman of the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee which oversees U.S. securities markets,
said this ethic permeated Wall Street as well as the Reagan
administration.
    He cited as examples a number of administration officials
tainted by charges of wrongdoing including ex-Reagan advisor
Michael Deaver, former national security aide John Poindexter
and former Environmental Protection Agency official Rita
Lavelle.
    Some Wall Street critics have blamed the insider trading
scandal on the so-called "Yuppie mentality", in which young
professionals strive for financial reward and neglect social
values.
    But Markey said the inspiration for this attitude came from
the administration.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Based on field travel in the
Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
    It said generally favorable weather from early December
through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
report said.
    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
serious storage problems, the report said.
    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
expected to be above average, it said.
    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
crop has been harvested.
    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
report said.
    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
for the decline are expected reduced government support price
and good summer crop harvests.

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia has secured total borrowings
this year for 1.95 billion dlrs, of which 1.40 billion
correspond to loans arranged before 1986, Director of Public
Credit Mauricio Cabrera said.
    Cabrera said about half of the borrowings would come from
the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
    He was speaking at a forum for industrialists upon his
return from London where he attended the signing of a 50 mln
dlr floating rate note, Colombia's first such offering on the
euromarket.
    Cabrera reaffirmed that Colombia has no intention of
rescheduling  its foreign debt, which he put at 14.35 billion
dlrs, of which 11.35 billion are from the public sector.
    For the international banking community, Colombia continues
to be "the best house in spite of being in the worst
neighbourhood," he said.
    He said debt servicing will remain a burden in 1987 and
will amount to 34.6 pct of total exports.

dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a
40-year low of 144.60 yen in nervous late morning trading,
currency dealers said.
     They said the size of the intervention was relatively
modest so far but it was a clear indication that the U.S.
remained committed to the late February Paris currency
stabilization accord, which was reaffirmed in Washington last
night.
    A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports.
    The dollar hovered around 144.70 just before midday.

in a bid to end its rule of Namibia (South West Africa).
    Their vetoes would repeat the joint action they took on
February 20 to bar selective sanctions against Pretoria over
its apartheid policy.
    "Measures of this sort would be counterproductive, giving
South Africa the excuse to remain intransigent," John Birch, the
British delegate, said. Vernon Walters, the U.S.

sanctions.

been extended indefinitely and to no person acquiring 20 pct or
more of the common stock prior to April 13, the company said.
    The plan calls for the attachment of one preferred stock
purchase right to each common share outstanding.
   On Monday, GenCorp announced it will buy up to 54 pct of its
own outstanding common shares for 130 dlrs per share. It said
details of the plan will be announced by the end of the week.

<TITLE>U.S. TAX INCREASE PROPOSED ON BEER AND WINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Cal, said
he introduced legislation to triple the federal excise taxes on
beer and on two types of wine which have the least alcohol.
    His bill would raise the tax on beer from nine dlrs to 27
dlrs per 31-gallon barrel, an increase of about 32 cents per
six pack. The tax on the two types of wine would go from 17
cents to 51 cents per gallon and from 67 cents to 2.01 dlrs per
gallon respectively, he said in a statement.
    "Raising the tax rates on beer and wine is an entirely
justifiable means of reducing the deficit. It would also
modestly discourage excessive drinking," Beilenson said.

<TITLE>MONSANTO &lt;MTC> UNIT SEES OPERATING LOSS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monsanto Corp's G.D. Searle and Co unit
said it will report an operating loss for 1987, mainly due to
expenses for research and development.
    Searle chairman Sheldon Gilgore said Searle's operating
loss in 1987 will be less than the 87 mln dlr operating loss in
1986.
    He said Searle's first quarter sales will be up 21.8 pct to
179 mln dlrs from 147 mln dlrs in the year ago quarter. In 1986
Searle's sales were 665 mln dlrs.
    Gilgore said the company intends to have sales of three
billion dlrs by the mid-1990s.
    He said the company anticipates approval in Japan, the
U.S., Italy, Spain and the U.K. for its ulcer treatment drug
Cytotech.
    He also said that in a paper not yet published the drug was
shown to prevent a flare-up of ulcers for a longer period of
time than Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beckman Corp &lt;SKB>.
    Other drugs in Searle's pipeline include tissue plasminogen
activator (TPA), made by a different process than Genentech's
&lt;GENE> TPA, expected to be approved for marketing this year.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN AIRLINES REPORT RECORD PASSENGER RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European airlines, hit by a drop in
business across the North Atlantic for much of last year, today
reported record passenger traffic for February.
    The 21-member Association of European Airlines said
passenger traffic in February was 11 pct higher than a year
earlier, allowing carriers to fill just under 60 pct of seat
capacity, the highest ever recorded in the month.
    On the North Atlantic route, where 1986 business suffered
because American visitors were deterred by the falling dollar,
fears of terrorism and the Chernobyl nuclear accident,
passenger traffic was up 15.5 pct.
    Improvements were also registered on South and
Mid-Atlantic, European, Asian and Middle East routes.
    "If the momentum is maintained AEA airlines can anticipate
sustained growth this summer -- in marked contrast to last
year," Henderson said in a statement.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States will push for a
strong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June
economic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiations
on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm
subsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.
    "Agriculture has really become the number one international
economic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state for
economic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.
    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leaders
identified agriculture as a major international problem but
made no specific recommendations.
    This year, Wallis said the U.S. will press for a statement
instructing trade ministers to begin negotiating on the issue,
and include domestic programs.
    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will
not conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a
push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"
negotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic
policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION AUTHORISED TO BUY MAIZE IN JUNE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Commission was authorised
to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores
in the second half of June, although sales into intervention
normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.
    They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management
Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC
and the United States.
    The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for
two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.
    The sources said the intervention price for the maize would
be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.
    They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full
    They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive
offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April
30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the
implementation of the accord with the United States.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corroon and Black Corp said &lt;Minet
Holdings PLC>, of which it owns 25 pct, agreed to participate
in a 103 mln stg fund set up by Lloyd's of London to cover part
of the claims faced by PCW underwriting agencies.
    The company said Minet and several other companies were
involved in the syndicate, which faces 235 mln stg in claims
due to fraud and mismanagement.
    The fund was proposed by Lloyd's to cover a portion of the
claims in return for a contribution of 34 mln stg from PCW
members. The offer is subject to acceptance by 90 pct of the
PCW members by May 30.
    Lloyd's 103 mln stg offer, including 48 mln stg from
Lloyd's and 55 mln stg from brokers, is designed to cover the
reinsurance costs on the 235 mln stg of net liabilities.
    Minet was unable to disclose the amount of its proposed
contribution to the fund, Caroon and Black said. However, Minet
was confident that the losses could be funded from existing
cash resources.
    Under the terms proposed, Lloyd's would take over all
members' future obligations connected with PCW, and members
would agree not to pursue the matter in court.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The consumption of some base metals,
along with dollar prices, are showing signs of modest
improvement, according to Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc (RTZ).
    However, the company said, iron ore markets have weakened.
    RTZ commodity specialist Philip Crowson told reporters he
thought base metals industry forecasts for 1987 were erring on
the side of caution, whereas forecasts for the last several
years had proven over-optimistic.
    RTZ said it expected to benefit from a rise in U.S. And
industrial production in 1987. Earlier, RTZ reported 1986 net
attributable profit of 245 mln stg against 257 mln in 1985.

<DATELINE>    Bogota, april 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The value of colombian exports other than
coffee rose 55 pct in january compared with the same period
last year, apparently setting a trend for the trade balance in
1987, government statistics institute figures show.
    They amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln
dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.
    The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.
    The national planning department forecast that in 1987
coffee, colombia's traditional major export, will account for
only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.

Palestinian guerrilla positions near Sidon in southern Lebanon
today in the ninth air raid over Lebanon this year, the
military spokesman said.
    "All our aircraft returned safely to base and the pilots
reported accurate hits," he said. The aircraft returned ground
fire, he said.
    The targets, three buildings on the outskirts of Ain
el-Hilweh refugee camp, were command posts for planning
guerrilla attacks, the military said.
    The army says Israel's air raids on its northern neighbour,
averaging two a month, are aimed mostly at Palestinian
guerrilla bases, weapons depots and launching posts for attacks
against Israel.
    The last Israeli Air Force attack was on March 23.

<TITLE>SOUTHMARK &lt;SM> TO OFFER SPECIAL DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Southmark Corp said it will issue its
shareholders a special dividend right to acquire 22 shares of
American Realty Trust &lt;ARB> for each 100 shares of Southmark
they own.
    Each right entitles the holder to buy one share of
beneficial interest of American Realty Trust at a price of 3.75
dlrs per share, Southmark said.
    Southmark said the offer's record date is May 1, with an
ex-dividend date of April 27, adding that the it will issue the
rights to shareholders on May 6 and the offer will expire on
May 22.
    Southmark said it received the rights on April 6 as the
holder of about 84 pct of American Realty Trust's outstanding
shares.
    Holders of fewer than 455 Southmark shares who would
receive rights to acquire fewer than 100 American Realty shares
will be paid cash in lieu of the rights distribution, the
company said.
    Southmark said it will compute the cash price paid based on
the average closing market price of the rights on the American
Stock Exchange for the first ten days the rights are traded,
beginning April 6.
    In order to get the dividend for these rights a Southmark
shareholder must own common stock on the ex-dividend date,
April 27, the company said.
    After that, Southmark said its common stock will be traded
on an ex-rights basis.

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombian exports other than coffee rose
55 pct in January compared with the same period last year,
figures from the government statistics institute show.
    Non-coffee exports amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared
with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last
year.
    The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
with a 56 mln dlr surplus in January 1986.
    The national planning department forecast that in 1987
coffee, Colombia's traditional major export, will account for
only one third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PUSH STRONG SUMMIT AGRICULTURE STATEMENT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States will push for a
strong statement from Western heads-of-state at the June
economic summit in Venice, urging "comprehensive" negotiations
on agriculture begin immediately to reduce domestic farm
subsidies, the senior U.S. planner for the summit said.
    "Agriculture has really become the number one international
economic problem," Allen Wallis, undersecretary of state for
economic affairs, told Reuters in an interview.
    At the Tokyo economic summit last year, western leaders
identified agriculture as a major international problem but
made no specific recommendations. This year, Wallis said the
U.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to
begin negotiating on the issue, and include domestic programs.
    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will
not conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a
push to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a "comprehensive"
negotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic
policies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.
    "They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic
policies, as well as trade arrangements," Wallis said.
    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit
statement of support for agriculture talks is part of an
overall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm
talks.
    Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the
Reagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue.
    Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will
repeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting
next week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda
of the trade ministers "quadrilateral" talks among
Japan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.
    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May will
highlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.
    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic
farm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies
among industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generous
in the EC and United States.
    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm
subsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, which
allows farm aid to be compared across countries.
    Some officials including British Agriculture Minister
Michael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a method
of negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.
    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE
can be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and "its not
definitive."
    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration
has not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture
proposal to present to the GATT.
    "I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,"
after the series of international meetings, Wallis said.
    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,
the United States has pushed for the so-called "freeze and
rollback" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current
levels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.
    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some trade
analysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian
prime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke
unveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce
the gap between high farm price supports and world prices.
    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13
coutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.
    "The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming
up with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which is
not what we think is what's called for here," Wallis said.
    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a "long-range"
solution to the agriculture problem.
    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal
because they said it deals primarily with the difference
between domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,
but fails to focus on the question of market access.
    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian
"quick fix", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for
a declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed
"expeditiously", or within two years.
    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keep
the pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement
program and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that a
sweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.

<TITLE>U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
recovery in April.
    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said
Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
weeks later than last year.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
5.7 pct last year.
    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
holiday nears.
    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward
Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
sportswear were also excellent.
    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"
said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
    J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued
strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
southwest."
    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear
Stearns.
    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher
comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
than last year.
    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
the year.
    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
May.

<TITLE>LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
pct.
    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
in aftermarket activity.
    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
currently associated with owning dollar securities.
    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
at less 1.75 less 1.55.
    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
144 yen.
    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second
seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve
in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.

<TITLE>LOWER U.S. FARM PAYMENT BASE EYED FOR SAVINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reducing the amount of crop base a
farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as
one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year
1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the
planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be
reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.
    The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up,
but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture
spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be
discussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.
    Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage
base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would
receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.
    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency
payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.
    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400
to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop
programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year
1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.
    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially
offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget
reconciliation bill.
    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut
one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing
acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,
implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the
use of generic in-kind certificates.

quarter earnings were reduced by 875,000 dlrs by placing 53.2
mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and six mln dlrs in loans to
Ecuador on a cash basis.
    Should these loans remain on nonperforming basis for the
rest of 1987, net income for year will be cut by about 3.2 mln
dlrs, the bank said.
    Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln
dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a
share.
    Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31,
up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March
31, 1986 the bank said.
    The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was
eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge
offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct
of outstanding loans, higher than the 56 mln dlrs of 1.65 pct
of loans outstanding at March 31, 1986.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKER CALLS FOR MORE TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A further cut in West German taxes to
overcome the current weakness of the domestic economy has been
called for by Thomas Wegscheider, management board chairman of
Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG.
    He said in  an interview due in tomorrow's Die Welt
newspaper that tax cuts already decided by the government
should be expanded by implementation of the "Stability Law,"
which allows tax cuts of up to 10 pct for a limited period.
    Wegscheider also said a temporary rise in state borrowing
resulting from such cuts would be tolerable, according to
excerpts of his remarks released early by Die Welt.
    In line with a pledge made at the Paris monetary conference
in February, the government announced in March that 5.2 billion
marks worth of tax cuts would be added on to reductions of some
nine billion marks already scheduled for next year.
    Wegscheider said the Bundesbank should pursue its policies
aimed at lower interest rates and said a reduction in money
market rates could encourage private capital market investment.
    Earlier today the Bundesbank's vice-president Helmut
Schlesinger said the central bank saw no current reason to
change its monetary course.

<TITLE>SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Conradi</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must
be provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference
in information requirements between notes and public bonds,
according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.
    The convention requires that lead managers draw up a
prospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain
details about the borrower.
    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must
merely be made available to clients on request via all
syndicate banks rather than published and distributed in
printed form.
    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this
month, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and
deals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly
anachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.
    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the
amount of information that should be provided by borrowers,
heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on
recent occasions .
    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss
francs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with
customers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.
    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the
unchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.
    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage
that the new requirement would present them with problems or
push up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been
providing more than the legal minimum of information.
    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were
also known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000
francs and placed largely with institutional investors.
    They were normally not brought onto the open market and
never quoted on the stock exchange.
    But over the years the distinction between notes and the
publicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The
National Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining
restrictions on maturities and denominations which still
formally divided them.
    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank
to rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely
as before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,
have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,
virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with
"information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.
    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says
each notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:
    - The precise terms of the issue
    - Details of the company performance if it is more than six
months since the last annual report
    - Naming of all guarantors
    - The source of the information
    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made
    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's
shares are listed and price high and lows over at least the
last three years.
    - That the lead manager has required the borrower to
provide information during the lifetime of the notes on the
progress of his business.
     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note
issues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs
last year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the
form of public bonds.
    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.

<TITLE>BRAZIL GOVERNORS CALL FOR REMOVAL OF FUNARO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's political crisis appears
to be deepening as powerful state governors are calling for the
removal of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of
economic policy.
    Commentators said their call, front-page headlines in
today's press, laid bare President Jose Sarney's political
weakness and highlighted Brazil's economic planning turmoil.
    The demand for Funaro's resignation came last night from
four governors with much combined political clout, those of Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. At
a news conference in Sao Paulo, they delivered a blunt message
-- the economy was in crisis and they wanted a new ministerial
team to shape policy. Otherwise there was a risk of social
chaos.

dlrs in February to total 17.05 billion dlrs, compared with
14.11 billion dlrs in February 1986, Bank of Spain figures
show.
    Under a new accounting system introduced this month,
Spain's foreign reserves now exclude foreign currency held by
financial institutions.
    Under the previous system, Spain's foreign reserves would
have risen by 391 mln dlrs in February, taking into account a
fall of 514 mln dlrs in financial institutions' foreign
currency position.
    In January this year, the Central Bank's foreign reserves
rose by 143 mln dlrs, while financial institutions' foreign
currency position fell by 118 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>SONY CHAIRMAN PLAYS DOWN TRADE CONFLICT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLMAR, France, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio
Morita played down the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict, saying
that direct investment abroad was the most effective way to
reduce Japan's trade surplus.
    Morita was speaking at the official opening of a 100
million franc (16.4 million dollars) compact disc player
factory in eastern France.
    He said trade friction between the U.S. And Japan over
high-technology was a very complicated and delicate issue but
that Sony intended to invest directly throughout the world.
    Referring to the European Community's stance against
turnkey plants, he said: "I know Brussels is not very favourable
to these so-called new Japanese 'screwdriver factories', but in
Sony's case our policy is quite different."
    The Colmar plant, Sony's third in France, would eventually
use local components and be a purely French factory, he said.
     Sony France SA was established in 1973. Its 1986 sales
were two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says it
expects sales of 2.7 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987.
Sony's other two French plants, in the south west of the
country, export over 80 per cent of their production.
    Company officials say that production from Sony's European
factories currently accounts for over 30 per cent of the
group's European sales and they expect this to increase. In
1986 over 20 per cent of Sony's eight billion dollar worldwide
sales were made in Europe.
    At the beginning of 1987, Sony employed about 1,100 people
in Europe. The group plans to open a compact disc software
factory in Austria this summer and an audio cassette plant in
Italy next year.

<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ugandan Finance Minister Chrispus
Kiyonga has asked the National Resistance Council, the
country's interim parliament, to approve 1,000 billion
shillings (714 mln dlrs) in extra government spending over the
last three months of this financial year, council sources said.
    Kiyonga told the council that because of high inflation,
estimated to be running at over 150 per cent a year, the
government needed extra money to keep its services running
until the financial year ends on June 30.
    The new appropriation requested by the minister is almost
as much as the 1,127 billion shillings (805 mln dlrs) the
government expected to spend during the whole year.
    Kiyonga said the government was having trouble keeping to
the deficit target of 350 billion shillings (250 mln dlrs)
contained in the original budget announced last August. The
deficit was to be financed by borrowing.
    The minister did not give a new budget deficit estimate.

francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance
Ministry said.
    The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the
goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.
    The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion
francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose
slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.
    Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher

<TITLE>WARD CRITICISES GUINNESS'S FEE COMPLAINT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> director Thomas
Ward told a High Court hearing that the company's action
against him and ex-chairman Ernest Saunders sought to give the
impression of an international hunt for Ward's 5.2 mln stg fee
in connection with the Distillers Co Plc &lt;DIST.L> takeover, the
Press Association news agency reported.
    In a sworn statement, Ward, a U.S. Lawyer, said Guinness
had failed to acknowledge that his attornies in March had
offered to put the money, less tax and various expenses, into
an escrow account where it could only be touched under agreed
circumstances.
    Ward said Guinness had made a transparent attempt to
belittle his services, the PA reported.
    "I wish to emphasise that the fee paid for my services was,
when considered out of context, admittedly very large."
    But every aspect of the (Distillers) bid - the size of the
target, the benefit to Guinness from success, the potential
damage from failure, the difficulties of the issues raised and
the cost for all services - were not merely large but virtually
unprecedented in the history of English takeovers," Ward said.
    Failure would have cost Guinness between 25 mln stg and 100
mln stg, he added.
    Ward said it was his idea to have a merger agreement with
Distillers under which Distillers agreed to pay Guinness's bid
costs, the PA reported.
    Ward's statement was read to the court by his lawyer Peter
Curry. Ward and ex-Guinness chairman Saunders want to end a
temporary court freeze of their assets up to the disputed
amount of the 5.2 mln stg fee which Guinness is trying to
recover.
    Guinness acquired Distillers in a fierecly fought 2.7
billion stg battle during 1986. The U.K. Government is also
probing the affair and has yet to report.

<TITLE>MEMBERS OF JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SHUN NAKASONE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of prime minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned
his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections.
    "His presence will do more harm than good," an LDP candidate
in Tokyo told Reuters. The candidate is one of several
conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry
against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.
    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down
before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10
if the LDP lost too many major local seats.
    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his
party to its greatest-ever election victory last July, and
analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.
    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of
polling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.
    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the
governorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centre
parties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,
who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist
parties.
    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.
    "The LDP and the centrist parties should have about
1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the
incumbent and has the sales tax weapon," said Rei Shiratori,
professor of political science at Dokkyo University.
    "Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if
the LDP wins in Fukuoka," he said.
    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the
governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.
    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at Hosei
University, said, "Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if
the LDP loses only in Hokkaido."
    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales
tax proposal.
    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to
overhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36
years.
    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese
domestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax
revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating
the economy.

<TITLE>DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
revenue.
    "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.
     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the
seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be
identified.
    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States said a new attack
by Iran in the Gulf war against Iraq does not appear to be a
major offensive.
    "We don't believe that what has been called Karbala-8 is a
major offensive," State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said.
    He was responding to Iran's announcement that it had
launched its second offensive in three days against Iraq.
    Karbala-8 is the code name for the attack in which both
sides have reported heavy fighting on the southern front near
the major Iraqi port of Basra.
    Redman said the offensive "appears to have been an Iran
attack which has not made much of an advance."
    Detailed information is lacking, he said, "but this seems
to be largely a repetition of the kind of fighting we had seen
previously in the same area east of Basra."
    Redman restated the U.S. call for an immediate end to
hostilities and said Washington "deplored the loss of life in
this tragic war."

compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

<TITLE>HUGHES' &lt;HT> U.S. RIG COUNT RISES TO 752</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. drilling rig count rose by four
last week to a total of 752, against 987 working rigs one year
ago, Hughes Tool Co said.
    In Canada, the rig count continued falling last week
because of the government's annual springtime ban prohibiting
heavy equipment from being transported over rain-softened
highways. A total of 85 rigs were working in Canada, down 46
from the previous week, Hughes said. At this time last year, a
total of 109 rigs were working in Canada.
    Among individual states, Louisiana and New Mexico each
reported drilling declines of 10 rigs and Kansas was down by
seven. Gains were reported in Oklahoma, Wyoming and Texas which
increased by 20, seven and one, respectively.
    Hughes said the total of 752 working rigs in the United
States included 17 in inland waters, 74 in offshore waters and
661 on land.

3,000 billion lire offer of short-term bills (BOTs) was mixed,
with six month paper oversubscribed but 12-month bills little
in demand, Bank of Italy figures show.
    Rates were unchanged on those indicated at the time the
offer was announced on April 4.
    The market was assigned all the 1,500 billion lire worth of
six-month bills on offer after requesting a total of 1,660
billion. Effective net annualized compound yield on the bills
is 9.19 pct, against 9.24 pct at the end-March auction.
    Of the 1,500 billion lire of 12-month paper offered,
operators requested and were assigned 911.975 billion lire at a
net annualized compound rate of 9.02 pct.
    The Bank of Italy took up the remaining 588.025 billion
lire of 12-month paper.
    The bills replace maturing paper worth 2,485 billion lire
of which 1,985 billion was in the hands of market operators and
the remainder with the Bank of Italy.

    UAL rose 1-5/8 to 73-5/8 on volume of more than two mln
shares, after trading with little upward movement earlier in

    Traders said rumors, which began yesterday, added to
speculation that the company would be the target of a takeover.
    They said it was believed Coniston Partners and the
Pritzker family of Chicago were buying the stock.
    Coniston declined comment and the Pritzkers had no comment.
    Traders said there was speculation a bidder might appear,
and also that real estate developer Donald Trump, who holds a
stake in UAL, might participate in a takeover bid. UAL pilots
said they would be willing to pay 4.5 billion dlrs, which
includes debt, for the company's United Airlines unit.

<TITLE>GREYCOAT GROUP SEEKS TWO FINANCINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Property company Greycoat Group Plc
is seeking two financings, one for 120 mln stg and the other
for 16 mln stg, in connection with its Embankment Place
development above and around Charing Cross station in London,
banking sources said.
    The first transaction, a 120 mln stg credit, will be
arranged by N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd and Bank of Tokyo
International Ltd on behalf of a special purpose Greycoat
subsidiary yet to be incorporated.
    It matures in June 1993 but will be extendible by up to two
years to June 1995 at the option of the borrower.
    The first credit, a project financing, will carry a basic
margin of 5/8 point over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR), with an additional 1/4 pct per annum payable on
outstanding amounts to the extent that the property is not
substantially pre-let.
    In addition, if the property is pre-sold while amounts are
still outstanding, the basic margin will be reduced to 1/2
point over LIBOR, the banking sources said.
    For a one year extension of the maturity an extra 1/8 point
margin will be paid, with a further 1/8 point if the maturity
is lengthened for the optional second year.
    There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on
available amounts and of 1/8 pct on unavailable amounts, the
sources said. Rothschild is sole agent for this transaction.
    The second transaction, a 16 mln stg credit for the purpose
of working capital, is being arranged by Rothschild alone on
behalf of the Greycoat Group Plc itself. It will be secured on
a property called Brettenham House.
    The margin will be 1/2 point over LIBOR in years one to
four, 5/8 point over LIBOR in years five and six and 3/4 point
over LIBOR thereafter. The credit will mature in June, 1995.
    The sources said that a commitment fee of 20 basis points
will be payable on the available tranche, with 10 basis points
on unavailable amounts.

<TITLE>SULPETRO AWAITS GOVERNMENT APPROVAL ON DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Sulpetro Ltd> said it had not
yet obtained Canadian government approval of a previously
reported agreement to restructure its 505 mln dlr debt, and
remaines dependent in the interim on support from its principal
banker.
    Sulpetro said it was operating as if the restructuring were
implemented, and was required to pay interest only on the term
loan part of its debt.
   It earlier said its net loss for the first quarter ended
January 31 fell to 9.9 mln dlrs from a restated year-earlier
loss of 17.3 mln dlrs.
    Sulpetro president Michael Williams declined to speculate,
in reply to a query, on when government approval of the
restructuring deal was likely.
    The company said first quarter costs fell to 25.4 mln dlrs
from year-ago 45.5 mln dlrs, due partly to lower sales costs
and reduced depletion because of its fiscal 1986 writedown.
    First quarter revenues fell to 14.7 mln dlrs from
year-earlier 29.8 mln because of lower wellhead prices, reduced
gas and natural gas liquids sales, disposal of its British
properties and surrender of part of the Irish-Lindbergh heavy
oil properties, Sulpetro said.

International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal
agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin
Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a
general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.
    Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions
from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour
an extension, delegates said.
    This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek
further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to
discuss internal matters.
    Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension
could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session
would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association
of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.
    The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after
a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.

<TITLE>FUNARO SHRUGS OFF CALLS FOR RESIGNATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro shrugged off demands by a group of Brazilian governors
that he resign.
    "At this moment I am discussing something much more serious
for Brazil and it's absolutely indispensible in a negotiation
like this one that I dedicate myself entirely to the
discussions," Funaro told reporters.
    Funaro, who spoke today to the International Monetary
Fund's interim committee, was referring to talks he began
Tuesday with creditor banks in New York in which unveiled
Brazil's economic targets and financial needs.
    The governor of Sao Paulo state Orestes Quersia and other
governors last night called on Brazilian President Jose Sarney
to assume direct control of the debt negotiations.
    Asked if the governors' demands for his resignation would
affect negotiations, Funaro said: "We are building a new
refinancing position and that is what we are doing now. The
rest is secondary."
    He added that Brazil's economic program clearly
demonstrates the intention to renegotiate the countries
international financial committments, and added: "The domestic
problems are our business."
    Funaro said discussions on Brazil's refinancing proposals
were well under way with private creditor banks and added World
Bank President Barber Conable had also accepted the proposals
as "a good plan" at a meeting they had last night.
    But Conable, who was also present at today's IMF interim
committee meeting told reporters that the World Bank wanted
further clarifications on Brazil's economic programs.
    "We wish further clarification about the program with
respect to adjustment lending," Conable said.
    He added that a World Bank mission would travel to Brazil
early next week to explore the state of Brazil's new economic
measures.

<TITLE>TEXACO CANADA &lt;TXC> LIKELY NOT IN A TEXACO PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texaco Canada Inc, 78 pct owned by
Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, likely would not form any part of a possible
settlement in a 10.3 billion U.S. dlr legal battle between
Texaco Inc and Penzoil Co &lt;PZL>, Texaco Canada chief executive
Peter Bijur told reporters.
    "I just just don't believe that it (Texaco Canada) would be
part of any settlement," Bijur said during a interview.
    Bijur said he could not comment directly on the
Texaco-Penzoil dispute, adding he had no first-hand information
concerning efforts by Texaco and Penzoil to resolve the matter.
    "We don't have any problems that I am aware of that are a
result of that litigation in the United States, and we continue
to do business on a normal, 'business as usual' basis," Texaco
Canada's Bijur told reporters during an interview session.
    As previously reported, Texaco Inc is seeking a court order
to block Pennzoil from taking action to secure a 10.3 billion
dlr judgement against Texaco.
    In reply to a query, Bijur said Texaco Inc has imposed no
spending retraints on Texaco Canada as it continues previously
reported efforts to make an energy-related acquisition.
    After considering making an acquisition for several months,
Texaco Canada set up a "business development team" of five people
about one month ago to increase its efforts, Bijur said. The
company has also widened the scope of its search to include
candidates involved in refining and marketing as well as
production segments of the industry.
    "We're going to widen the scope of our view. We're going to
look at the downstream and we're going to look at the entire
petroleum business," he said.
    Bijur declined to specify how much money Texaco Canada
would spend on an acquisition.
    Bijur said the company was not close to concluding any
acquisitions and declined to specify when he expected a
transaction might be made. "We're not in a hurry," he said.
    Texaco Canada said in the annual report it had a cash
position of 808 mln dlrs at the end of 1986, and Bijur said the
company's cash fund has not changed materially during the first
quarter.
    Commenting on earnings results, Bijur said he expected
first quarter profit to be lower than last year's earnings of
84 mln dlrs or 70 cts a share, due to lower profit contribution
from production because of lower oil prices.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House of Seagram, Seagram Co Ltd's
U.S. marketing arm for Joseph E. Seagram and Son's distilled
spirits and wine coolers, said it is replacing its four current
national spirits companies with a single sales force, one
marketing unit and a centralized finance and administrative
function.
    Effective May four, House of Seagram said its sales force
will operate nationally through seven, equal-sized regions,
five in open states and two in control states, Seagram said.
    The change reflects a more aggressive marketing and sales
focus on the local level, the company said.
    A vice president-general manager will head each region,
reporting to Jerome Mann, executive vice president, Seagram
said, adding that Sales, Seagram Distillers, 375 Spirits,
Perennial Sales and Summit Sales will cease to exist as
companies.
    "We will no longer have individual spirits companies, the
resulting internal competition for distributor and retailer
attention or centalized decision making on virtually all
issues," Edgar Bronfman, House of Seagram president, said.
    Seagram said the group that markets Seagram's line of wine
coolers, the be caled the Seagram Beverage Co, will not be
affected by the reorganization.
    The company added that Seagram Beverage will remain inside
the House of Seagram, but separate from the spirits unit.

<TITLE>IRT PROPERTY LAUNCHES DEBENTURE IN EUROMARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>IRT Property Co, a real estate investment
trust based in Atlanta, Georgia, has launched a 30 mln dlr
convertible subordinated debenture in the Euromarket, a partner
of Chandler Partnership Ltd said.
    The issue is unique in several respects and is only one of
a handful of such deals to be brought to this market, he said.
    Unlike most eurobonds, the issue will not be underwritten.
Instead, IRT mandated Chandler Partnership to find potential
investors with whom the issue can be preplaced and to then
place on a "best efforts" basis what ever amount may not be
subscribed.
    Chandler itself was set up in the Isle of Jersey in the
middle of last year as a partnership, whose members have been
involved in financial markets.
    The deal has two sponsors who assist in the placement--
Interallianz Bank Zurich AG and Nivison Cantrade Ltd, a small
U.K. Trading firm that formerly was broker R. Nivison and Co.
    The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annual
coupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be converted
into shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.
    IRT's shares closed last night on the New York Stock
Exchange at 19-7/8.
    The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and are
callable at the company's option after the first two years.
    On or after August 1989 the company can call half the
debentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of the
conversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of the
conversion price, Nivison said.
    In addition, holders will be able to surrender half the
bonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of
7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for a
yield of 7.383 pct.
    The payment date is June 1, 1987. The debentures will be
listed in London and the fees for the deal total 2-1/4 pct.
    Nivison said that the deal contains a convenent which
states that if the company's debt to equity ratio exceeds two
to one the debentures cannot be converted unless the company
obtains a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.
    Nivison said IRT's debt to equity ratio currently is less
than one to one.
    The Chandler partner said that this type of deal gives the
borrower funds that are less costly than if it had done an
issue in the U.S. Domestic market.

trade and Egyptian official sources said.
    Trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an
Egyptian company, Islamic Corp, at 85.80 dlrs/tonne cost and
freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90
and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.
    An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation
of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said
the government had refused for legal reasons.
    The official denied trade reports that the government might
have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the
original tender.

earlier.
    The spokesman said the order had reduced the number of
redundancies necessary but was not large enough to avoid job
losses. The total group workforce is 11,000. The company was
rescued last year by a consortium of United Technologies Corp's

has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and

    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
which will be voted on in the House next month.
    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
staff member of the committee told Reuters.
    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile
over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee
the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over
decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
management was counter-productive, he said.

<TITLE>CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's trade picture has brightened
considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
would post a long awaited recovery this year.
    The federal government reported today that the monthly
surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
year.
    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the
Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
dls in the month.
    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its
monthly report.
    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
dlrs.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
the country.
    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's
Donegan.
    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
trade upturn.
    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
probably transitory."

<TITLE>FIRST BANK &lt;FBS> SEES LOSS ON BRAZILIAN LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Bank Systems Inc, in reporting
higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on
the 140 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in
Ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the
entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.
    The banking firm said the non-performing status of these
loans cut first quarter net by 1.7 mln dlrs.
    Earlier it reported first quarter profits of 57.4 mln dlrs
or 95 cts a share, up from 46.6 mln dlrs or 80 cts a share in
the year-ago period.
    Nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate
were 637 mln dlrs, or 2.24 pct of total assets, compared to 514
mln dlrs or 1.84 pct of assets at the end of 1986 and 636.1
mln, or 2.46 pct of assets at March 31, 1986.
    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 35 mln
dlrs, compared to 152.1 mln in the first quarter 1986, when
there was a special addition to the reserve of 100 mln dlrs.
Net charge offs were 34.7 mln, compared to 41.1 mln dlrs a year
earlier.

<TITLE>SALOMON INC &lt;SB> DENIES RUMORS OF BOND LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Salomon, managing director of
Salomon Inc, said rumors the Wall Street firm suffered bond
trading losses in the first quarter are not true.
    Salomon said the rumors affected the company's stock and 
are "unequivocally denied."
    The Salomon share price was off 5/8 at 37-1/2, but it had
been off more than one dlr on heavy volume earlier in the day.
    Analysts said the rumors have been circulating in the
market for several days.
   
    Salomon said the firm will report first quarter results on
April 22 or 23.
    Analysts said the stock would have reacted poorly today,
even without the rumors, because of the decline in the stock
and bond markets.
    Other brokerages were also down today. E.F. Hutton &lt;EFH>
fell one to 41-1/4. Bear Stearns and Co &lt;BSC> slipped 3/8 to
19-1/2. PaineWebber Group &lt;PWJ> fell 1/2 to 36, and First

<DATELINE>    GLENVIEW, ILL., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Clevite Industries Inc, which
earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.
Industries Inc &lt;JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights
Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
company and stockholders.
    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to
issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
price.
    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
approval.
    The company said it acted inview of the proposed
acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block
its ability to redeem the rights.

<TITLE>NET CHANGE IN EXPORT COMMITMENTS -- USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department gave
the net change in export commitments, including sales,
cancellations, foreign purchases and cumulative exports, in the
current seasons through the week ended April 2, with
comparisons, as follows, in tonnes, except as noted --
                        4/2/87   Prev Week
            All Wheat   119,800    368,300

            Cotton-Y     60,200     31,900
   x-minus total. Y-running bales.
    The indicated totals include reported commitments to both
named and unnamed destinations, sales on exporters' own account
and optional origin sales plus actual exports already made
during the respective marketing seasons.
    The USDA cautions that reported outstanding sales are
subject to modification, deferral or cancellation and it is
unlikely that all reported quantities will be exported.
    USDA gave detailed breakdowns for the 1986/87 and 1987/88
seasons as follows, in thousand tonnes unless stated --
 (A) - Firm sales to a declared destination.
 (B) - Ultimate destination not yet declared.
 (C) - Sales made on exporters' own account.
 (D) - Exporter holds option to fill commitment with supplies 
from origins other than U.S.
 (E) - Accumulated exports since season began based on data 
reported by exporters.
 (F) - Indicated total for season.
 (G) - USDA-projected exports for season.
 Note -- Totals may not add due to rounding.

<TITLE>HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Armed Services Committee
has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
which will be voted on in the House next month.
    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
staff member of the committee told Reuters.
    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile
over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    The staffer said that under the measures passed by the
committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence
over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
management was counter-productive, he said.

<TITLE>MIYAZAWA WARNS ABOUT CURRENCY SHIFTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said that further substantial exchange rate shifts
could damage the prospects for growth and adjustment and called
for cooperation in exchange markets.
    In a statement to the International Monetary Funds Interim
Committee, Miyazawa said it was imperative that current account
surplus countries follow policies designed to strengthen
domestic demand and reduce surpluses while maintaining price
stability. He said Japan intended to carry out policies
announced at the Paris meeting of finance ministers to
stimulate its economy.
    Miyazawa said that, given the massive external imbalances
and serious unemployment in some countries, "there are very real
fears of a protectionist uprising."
    In addition, "we are most concerned about this very serious
problem of exchange rate instability," Miyazawa said.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in
the European/Mediterranean area continued to show strong gains
last week, increasing nearly two percentage points to 46.1 pct,
Offshore Data Services said.
    The total number of working rigs in Europe and the
Mediterranean region was 71, reflecting an increase of three
during the week, compared to a total of 111 working rigs at
this time last year. In the previous week, the area also gained
three working rigs.
    Offshore Data Services said the worldwide utilization rate
for the week remained steady at 53.9 pct, reflecting a total of
392 working rigs. Last year, a total of 479 rigs were working
throughout the world.
    In the Gulf of Mexico, the utilization rate decreased
slightly to 35.5 pct, from 35.6 pct the previous week because
of the addition of one rig to the Gulf fleet. A total of 83
rigs were working last week in the Gulf out of a fleet of 234.

<TITLE>SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
month.
    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
USDA said.
    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
average winter-kill," USDA said.
    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
grain recently.
    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

<TITLE>DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR &lt;HLY></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Roy Disney family disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made
a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and
securities.
    Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family
company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon
Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.
    The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that
would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
share of Holly Sugar outstanding.
    The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares
or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.
    Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
    "Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
including price," it said in its April 8 letter.

<TITLE>RAI RESEARCH &lt;RAC> SEES LOWER SALE IN NEAR TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAUPPAUGE, N.Y, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>RAI Research Corp said it appears
that the reduced level of sales may continue for the near term.
    Earlier, RAI reported that third quarter net declined to
17,806 dlrs on sales of 1.3 mln dlrs from net income of 328,290
dlrs on sales of 2.2 mln dlrs a year ago.
   It said sales declined as a result of reduced sales of
permion battery separators to Japanese customers and it does
not know the duration or extent of these factors.

73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).

<TITLE>USDA FLORIDA ORANGE REPORT CONSIDERED BEARISH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department's
latest estimates on 1986/87 Florida orange production and
orange juice yield are bearish for the frozen concentrated
orange juice futures market because the yield increase was
greater than expected, FCOJ traders and analysts said.
    The USDA projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of FCOJ
per box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.
    The government estimated Florida orange production
(excluding Temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln last
month. Temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.
    Traders and analysts said the unexpectedly large yield
increase outweighed the anticipated drop in box count.

<TITLE>NORANDA BEGINS SALVAGE OPERATIONS AT MURDOCHVILLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Toronto, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Noranda Inc> said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as
24 hours before they were brought to safety.
    Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed
6,000 feet of conveyor belt.
     Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp
leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company
said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation
along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
     Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone
will not be completed before the end of April.
    Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the
Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting
an investigation into the fire.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until the
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680
people.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter

Stockholders Protective Committee of Freedom Federal Savings
Bank to nominate two candidates for election to the Freedom
board at the April 20 annual meeting.
    It said the committee's nominees, Richard Fisher, Diana
chairman and Harold Sampson, a Diana director, will oppose
nominees of the present board of directors.
    Diana, which is 60 pct owned by Farm House Foods Corp
&lt;FHFC>, owns 105,554 shares of Freedom Federal common stock.
    Diana noted that Freedom Federal's board recently declared
a distribution of Preferred Stock Purchase Rights "with the aid
of which such directors might disapprove, and perhaps prevent,
possible acquisition offers or substantial stock accumulations,
regardless of how beneficial they might be to the
stockholders."
    The company said "we want to increase the responsiveness of
the (Freedom Federal) board to stockholder concerns."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction," Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    "An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said its auction of
9.76 billion dlrs of 52-week bills produced an average rate of
5.92 pct.
    The rate was up from 5.68 pct at the last auction of
one-year bills on March 12.
    At today's sale, the bond-equivalent yield was 6.30 pct. 
Accepted bids ranged from 5.88 pct to 5.93 pct and 80 pct of
bids at the high, or stopout, rate were taken.
    The Treasury received 26.7 billion dlrs of bids, including
554 mln dlrs in non-competitive bids from the public.
    The average price of the one-year bills was 94.014 and the
range was 94.055 to 94.004.
    The average rate of 5.92 pct was the highest since 5.98 pct
on July 8, 1986.

<TITLE>KIDDER, PEABODY DEFENDS EMPLOYEE DRUG TESTING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kidder, Peabody and Co vice president
Edward Weihenmayer said his company was giving drug tests to
all employees to make sure its funds and assets were being
handled properly.
    "Drugs are easily available in the Wall Street area,"
Weihenmayer told the Senate Judiciary Committee. "We move
billions of dollars around in tens of thousands of transactions
daily and have a legitimate interest in the safety and security
of those assets."
    He said customers had a right to expect that their funds
were being handled by sober and drug-free professionals.
    Weihenmayer said almost all Wall Street firms were testing
new employees and many were testing all workers.
    He said Kidder, Peabody would try to help anyone found to
be using drugs, but those who failed a second test would almost
certainly be fired.
   "Our objective is to strive for a drug-free enviroment," he
said.
    Committee chairman Joseph Biden said drug tests posed a
difficult problem in balancing the rights of workers with the
need for companies to eliminate drugs from the work-place.
    "There is no easy answer," the Delaware Democrat said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fundamental Brokers Institutional
Associates, a leading inter-dealer broker in U.S. government
securities, said it has agreed to acquire certain assets of MKI
Government Brokers Inc for undisclosed terms.
    Acquisition documents have been signed and are being held
in escrow pending the receipt of certain consents, it said.
    In conjunction with the sale of assets, MKI has ceased
brokering treasury bills, notes and bonds, Fundamental said.
    Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental
was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage
division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds.
    Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly
used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the
most active Treasury issues.
    By separating the execution of wholesale trades from the
heavy volume of smaller lots, large-scale transactions will be
facilitated, the company said.
    "The new system is expected to substantially enhance the
liquidity and effiency of markets," Fundamental said.
    The wholesale brokering service will begin on or around
April 20.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA WARNS IT MAY CUT OFF TALKS WITH BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Hume, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's Economy Minister Juan
Sourrouille said the "narrow interest" of creditor banks was
holding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warned
Argentina may break off negotiations.
    "It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of some
banks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for a
policy we have agreed with the international community,"
Sourrouille said.
    Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's Interim
Committee meeting, Sourrouille said Argentina had given ample
proof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.
    "Today, with that same responsibility, we are clearly
stating that it will be imposible for us to continue
negotiating on that basis."
    A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from a
vantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker,
said Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the names
of banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.
    "Let's give them a call right away," the source quoted Baker
as saying.
    Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMF
last February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and a
longer-term credit, known as an extended Fund Facility for
another 500,000 dlrs.
    But he said that despite Argentina's "disciplined effort" to
achieve inflation-free economic growth, it was unable to obtain
IMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement and
settlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks.
    Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting a
long-established practice under which debtor countries which
reached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were a
good credit risk for the banks.
    "In other words, facts are demonstrating that the current
debt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weak
signal for the beginning of another discussion (with the
banks)," he stated.
    He added the fact that the strategy is not working was also
demonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's program
had to join in a bridge loan for his country.
    Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirements
regarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscal
policies.
    Despite this Sourrouille said, "What we are facing is the
inexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blocking
negotations."
    Argentina, with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs, has been
seeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in "old debt" and another
4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985.
    The minister also said there were two issues separating
Argentina from an accord with creditor banks, one was a minimum
difference on the interest rate margin above international
levels.
    The other condition, of more concern, were suggestions by
the banks that would upset the country's financial system.
    Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offering
Argentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct, which
they gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement.
    The sources said Argentina is committed to winning the
lower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor.

<TITLE>ROCKY MOUNT &lt;RMUC> HOLDERS SEEK BOARD CONTROL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>A shareholder group controlling 48.3
pct of the stock of Rocky Mount Undergarment Co Inc told the
Securities and Exchange Commission it will try to take control
of the company by taking over its board of directors.
    The group, which includes David Greenberg, Rocky Mount's
former president, and several other members of the Greenberg
family, said it had been close to an agreement with the company
on board representation when talks broke down.
    As a result, it will propose its own slate of directors and
vote for that slate at the company's April 24 annual  meeting,
the group said.
    David Greenberg had been president and chairman of Rocky
Mount until May 1986 when he resigned at the board's request.
    David's younger brother, Herbert Greenberg, was a vice
president until November 1986, when he was fired by the board.
    However, Herbert refused to resign his board seat and
remains a company director.
    Rocky Mount sued the group in federal court in North
Carolina earlier this month, charging that its accumulation of
Rocky Mount stock amounted to an illegal tender offer in
violation of the federal securities laws.

<TITLE>USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
buyers.
    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
four-week average, it said.
    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
    Other significant purchasers for the current year were
Mexico and Honduras, it said.
    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
purchasers, the department said.
    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
Department said.
    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
but nine pct below the four-week average.
    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

    Westinghouse recorded net income for the first quarter of

<TITLE>AMR (AMR) TO START INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMR Corp's American Airlines will start
its own information campaign in its dispute with the
Association of Professional Flight Attendants.
    The company, which has been negotiating with its 10,000
attendants since late last year, will give out information
brochures at its terminals, outlining its position, according
to L.C. Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.
    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA was
conducting a "smear campaign" by handing out leaflets at the
company's terminals. The union says it was trying to win public
support by presenting its position.
     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants for
handing out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The
union is fighting the move in court.
     In response to a question, Duncan said the company's
latest proposal for a new three-year contract, which was
offered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,
whereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than those
hired before 1983.
     However, the union has contended that the company's
proposal keeps the system in a disguised form.
     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response to
American's announcement.
     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle of
a federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that was
triggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer
of binding arbitration.
     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free to
strike and the company is free to unilaterally impose its
latest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.
     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will not
strike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has received
permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed up
the hiring of new attendants.
     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company was
thinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.
     "It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,"
he said.

in the U.S. of its "Europe on Us" for travel from the U.S. due
to disapproval by the U.S. Department of Transporation on
grounds of reciprocity.
    Under the promotional program, customers would buy a round
trip from the U.S. to London and would receive a free round
trip ticket from London to one of 45 cities in 16 countries.
    A company spokesman said the Transportation Department's
contention was that American carriers could not compete in this
program. British Airways said it is seeking a review of the
decision.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
dlrs in the first week of the period.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
447 mln dlrs.
    A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
the week ended Wednesday.
    Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
pct of the borrowing.
    Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
    Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
    The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
    About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
bank.
    As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,
when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were
corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction
was made to unposted funds at a single bank.
    In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,
banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week
but ran a deficit on Wednesday.
    In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday
and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.

<DATELINE>     TORONTO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Noranda Inc said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec mine where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor
belt.
    The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe
rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.

<TITLE>LTV &lt;QLTV> TO MAKE ONE-TIME BENEFIT PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>LTV Corp said it will seek approval from
the U.S. bankruptcy court to make one-time hardship payments to
retired steelworkers who lost some pension benefits when their
retirement plans were terminated.
    The payments would range from 100 dlrs to 750 dlrs per
person for more than 9,800 steel company salaried and hourly
retirees, LTV said.
    The company's steel unit retirement plans were terminated
in January by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, which
said the plans were insolvent.
    LTV filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July 17.
    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors
while it works out a plan to pay debts.
    While most regular pension payments were continued after
LTV Steel Co's pension plans were terminated, some retirees got
a reduction in their supplemental early retirement benefits or
other payments that were more than maximums guaranteed by the
federal agency.
    LTV also began talks with the United Steelworkers union,
and both sides have made a commitment to reach a new labor
agreement by May 1, the steel, aerospace and energy concern
said.
    LTV has the right to renegotiate its labor contracts while
operating in Chapter 11. At issue are pension and health
benefits for active and retired employees and other items, such
as use of manpower and equipment.
    The company plans to present a comprehensive proposal to
the U.S. bankruptcy court in May to deal with pensions and
health care benefits for steel and energy retirees and health
care benefits for aerospace retirees, it said.
    All LTV retirees are currently receiving health and life
insurance payments mandated by federal laws passed in October
that have been extended until May 15.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS VOLCKER WILL NOT SERVE NEW TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said Paul Volcker has
declined to serve another term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, the U.S. central bank. Reagan
nominated economist Alan Greenspan in his place.
    Volcker's term expires in August.
    Reagan, in a brief announcement in the White House briefing
room, said he accepted Volcker's decision "with great reluctance
and regret."
    Volcker, first appointed to the Fed post by President Jimmy
Carter in 1979, said "there is a time to leave and a time to
come ... I have no feeling I was being pushed."
    Volcker, appearing with Reagan, Greenspan, and Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the briefing room, said he will remain
on the job until Greenspan's nomination is approved by the
Senate.
    In a tribute to a smiling Volcker standing beside him,
Greenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman's
greatest achievements was reducing inflation.
    "It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain
that those very hard won gains will not be lost. Assuring that
will be one of my primary goals," Greenspan said.
    Financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure of
Volcker, who has been widely credited with holding the line on
inflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values.
    Immediately following Reagan's announcement, the U.S.
dollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and both
the bond and stock markets declined.
    But Greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar, which
has fallen sharply over the past year, has reached its low
point.
   
    "There certainly is evidence in that direction," Greenspan
said when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out.
    The market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprise
because the announcement followed a number of published reports
that the White House had decided to reappoint Volcker.
    Volcker's tenure at the Fed began under the cloud of major
inflation under Carter with consumer prices rising more than 10
per cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 per
cent.
   
    With Reagan's backing, Volcker pursued a tight money policy
that cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reduced
interest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade.
    The tight money policies were also blamed for producing
a deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major political
problems for Reagan.
    Reagan reappointed Volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.
   
    Greenspan, who heads his own Wall Street consulting firm,
was chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers
from September 1974 until January 1977.
    Greenspan, a Republican, is considered a traditional
conservative economist and has been an adviser to several
presidents.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgium's public expenditure deficit
fell sharply to 59.5 billion francs in May from 96.7 billion in
the same month last year, the first major sign of the effects
of the government's public spending curbs, the Budget Ministry
said.
    During the first five months of this year, the net
government financing requirement was down by 44.1 billion
francs from year ago levels at 345.8 billion francs, it said in
a statement.
    The government is aiming to cut this year's financing
requirement to below 420 billion francs this year from around
560 billion in 1986.
    The Ministry said it was expected that more than half the
projected cut should have been achieved by the end of July.
    Ministry sources noted that for technical reasons, the
financing requirement is always highest in the early months of
the year.

<TITLE>PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ISLAMABAD, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan says its economy has continued
its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
investments and energy were causing concern.
    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
to a government economic survey.
     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
and there was an impressive performance in a five point
government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
alleviation, said the survey.
    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
    More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
home remittances, he said.
    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
the boost in exports.
    He said national investment continued to be small because
of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

of Dominion Resources Inc, is raising 100 mln dlrs via an
offering of first and refunding mortgage bonds due 2017
yielding 9.89 pct, said sole manager E.F. Hutton and Co Inc.
    Hutton led a group that won the bonds in competitive
bidding. It bid them at 99.376, representing a net interest
charge to the company of 9.94 pct.
    The underwriter set a 9-7/8 pct coupon and reoffering price
of 99.85 to yield 123 basis points more than comparable
Treasury securities. Non-refundable for five years, the bonds
are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard and Poor's.
    The gross spread is four dlrs and the reallowance is 2.50
dlrs, bookrunner Hutton said of the Virginia Electric deal.
    Virginia Electric last visited the domestic debt market in
October 1986 when it sold 100 mln dlrs of same-rated,
same-maturity 9-1/4 pct bonds. That issue was priced to yield
9.27 pct, or 141 basis points over Treasuries.

<TITLE>ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's barley crop is generally in good
condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
said.
    First consignments were expected to be available around
mid-June.
    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
because of extreme dryness.
    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.

<TITLE>EC FARM MINISTERS DISAGREE ON DIRECT INCOME AIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENVAL, Belgium, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans to provide direct income
aids for European Community (EC) small farmers to help them
face deep cuts in guaranteed crop prices received a mixed
reception from EC agriculture ministers, EC officials said.
    The plans were discussed at an informal meeting of the
ministers hosted in the village of Genval by the Council of
Ministers' current chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker.
    The EC Executive Commission has proposed that the richer
member states be allowed to make direct payments to their
farmers in special difficulties, while the EC itself would
finance a similar scheme in the poorer EC countries.
    However, EC officials said only the Netherlands and
Luxembourg supported this idea at today's meeting, and France,
Denmark and Belgium showed marked hostility to it.
    French minister Francois Guillaume told reporters, "Farmers
should not become recipients of public assistance -- their
survival should be assured by price mechanisms and the market."
    The officials said the ministers had not sought to resolve
their more urgent differences over guaranteed farm prices for
1987/88 at this meeting.
    The ministers will resume talks on the price fixing issue
in Luxembourg on June 15.

    A company spokesman said members of Local Two of the
Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers, who had walked out
May 10, reached "mutually agreeable terms" in a new two-year
contract.
    Meanwhile, about 100 Teamster drivers and warehouse
employees, whose contract expired May 16, remained out, the
company said. No new talks were scheduled, Sara Lee said.
    Details of the new contract were not immediately available,
but a company spokesman said it "maintained benefits and called
for no sacrifices from current employees."
    Union sources reported that the contract freezes wages and
introduces a sharply lower starting rate for new hires. They
said it also gives Sara Lee concessions on a workplace issue
involving excused absences.

<TITLE>CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A representative of the poultry
industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently
the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or
salads and other mixed foods.
    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries
and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House
Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken
has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither
the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an
increase in outbreaks of the disease.
    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that
between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all
U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct
of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.
    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and
mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.
    May said the chicken industry favored moving away from
bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system
better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination
of poultry.
    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be
retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook
chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures
necessary to avoid illness.
    Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry
inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.

to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
floor last week.
    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
be changed.
    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending
into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to
meet stiff resistance in the full House.

<TITLE>EC BUDGET MINISTERS SET TO REFUSE PLEA FOR CASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A plea for extra cash to bail the
European Community (EC) out of its latest financial crisis was
likely to be rejected at a meeting today of EC budget
ministers, diplomats said.
    The ministers were meeting for the first time since the EC
Executive Commission unveiled an emergency budget for 1987
aimed at plugging a deficit caused by soaring farm spending and
falling revenues.
    The emergency package includes a demand for member states
to pay an extra 1.5 billion European currency units (Ecus) to
help meet the deficit.
    Officials said Britain and West Germany were expected to
lead opposition to contributing any extra cash, with the U.K
insisting instead on a clampdown on runaway farm spending.
    The Commission says there will be a shortfall of at least
five billion Ecus this year, more than 1/8 of total spending.
    It hopes to make up much of the shortfall in a one-time
accounting exercise by paying member states in arrears rather
than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies.
    But if member states do not make up the rest of the gap,
the Commission has warned that spending on regional and social
projects could be slashed by half.

it was detaining without trial has dropped to 1,500, far fewer
than previous official figures during the past year of
emergency rule.
    A government spokesman said the latest set of names,
presented to parliament, included all current detainees who had
been held for over a month. Previous lists have named up to
8,500 people.
    The official figure was supported by civil rights groups
who said many detainees had been freed in recent weeks,
possibly to empty cells for a new government crackdown.

<TITLE>JAPANESE FARMERS PROTEST OPENING MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thousands of farmers gathered in central
Tokyo to urge the government to stand firm against foreign
pressure for further opening up of Japan's markets to foreign
agricultural products, union officials said.
    Officials of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives
said about 5,000 representatives from 4,200 farming groups
joined the demonstration.
    The organisers said the farmers demanded that the
government should avoid easy compromises on liberalising
agricultural imports at next week's economic summit in Venice.
    The United States and the European Community want Japan to
remove tariffs and quotas to help cut their trade deficits with
Japan.
    Under a banner reading "The government and parliament must
not sacrifice farmers," the demonstrators adopted a declaration
saying they would fight any unreasonable moves to open Japanese
markets to foreign agricultural products.
    An agriculture ministry official said Japan and the United
States were expected to hold talks on Japanese import ceilings
for U.S. Beef and citrus fruit in September.

<TITLE>FRESH DEBATE ON NORWAY'S EC MEMBERSHIP WELCOMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OSLO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community officials welcomed
Norway's recent move to renew a public debate on Community
membership but said Norway should not expect special trade
advantages as long as it stays outside the EC.
    Belgian Willy de Clercq, EC Commissioner on external
affairs and trade policy, said high level talks this week with
Norway's minority Labour government had helped clarify several
misconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of EC
membership in a 1972 referendum.
    "But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outside
the club. You can expect equal footing in the club, but not out
of it," de Clercq added, referring to Norway's attempts to adapt
its EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch an
internal trade market from 1992.
    The government, worried that the internal market will
hamper trade with the EC, which takes about two-thirds of
Norway's exports, last month sent a report to parliament asking
political parties and the public to reassess the country's
relationship to the EC.

<TITLE>VOLCKER IN LETTER DECLINES NEW FED TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the full text of Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President
Reagan declining reappointment to the Fed:
    Dear Mr. President,
    As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate
new appointment.
   
    In that connection, you will recall that, upon my
reappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firm
commitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a
second full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the
time, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I do
think, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now
come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably
convenient and consistent with an orderly transition.
Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I
plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to
assume office.
   
    I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for
your unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, your
consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a
particularly challenging period for it, for the financial
system, and for the economy has been critical to whatever
success we have had.
   
    Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those
involved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe the
nation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal
Reserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering
economic and financial strength and stability and able to bring
to that effort a combination of sound and independent
professional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan
considerations.
   
    May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainder
of your own term in office during which you have done so much
to restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the
American people.
    Faithfully yours,
    Paul A Volcker

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The scale of foreign exchange intervention
the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been
playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market
pressures there are from time to time."
    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson
said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

<TITLE>CSFB ECONOMIST SAYS VOCLKER'S RESIGNATION A SHOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The decision by Paul Volcker not to serve
a third term as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is a
shock for financial markets and the world economy, Hans Mast,
senior economic adviser to Credit Suisse First Boston, said.
    "The markets will believe there will be pressure for a more
expansive policy (in the United States)," he said.
    "I would say this is quite a shock for the world economy," he
added. "He always stood for an anti-inflationary policy and
tight fiscal discipline. He was one of the best central bankers
America has had."
    Mast said the markets would now be trying to assess what
sort of direction the Fed would be taking under Alan Greenspan,
designated to succeed Volcker.
    "Greenspan is more of a politician than an academician, but
the most important thing is that he has little experience in
banking," Mast said.
    Greenspan's first comments on being named were that the
dollar appeared to have bottomed out but Mast said that
conviction would have to be backed by policy. "How can you say
the dollar has bottomed out with the present level of current
account deficits?" he said. "I would be sceptical."

Lehman Brothers Inc, said news that Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker declined to accept reappointment would have only a
short-term effect on financial markets.
    "The markets should not go into a panic," Sinai told a
fixed-income conference in New York sponsored by the Institute
for International Research.
    Sinai said he thought that Volcker was one of the best Fed
governors in the country's history. Still, he predicted that
the markets would calm after today's tremors.
    Alan Greenspan has been nominated to replace Volcker.

    "While Paul Volcker's retirement is a real loss, this
country is very fortunate to have a man of Alan Greenspan's
caliber to take his place," Dole said in a statement.
    "Alan's knowledge of the economy, coupled with his
experience at the top levels of government, means that the
leadership of the Federal Reserve Board will be in good hands.
Alan, literally, has some big shoes to fill. But I haven't any
doubts he's more than equal to the task," Dole said.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the
Senate Energy Committee.
    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.

<TITLE>JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Greensboro, N.C., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to
grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
Samjens Acquisition Corp.
    "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
injunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments by
attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
    "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
winners," he said.
    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
obtained confidential information about the company to make its
offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
Canada, were to succeed.
    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
"kill the offer"
    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we
cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in
this for the money," he said.
    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
takeover of Burlington.
    "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
Jim Ammeen," Nathan said.
    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
said he would not rule on the request today.

CCC-plus from B-minus Coleco Industries Inc's 300 mln dlrs of
subordinated debt.
    The company's implied senior debt rating is B.
    S/P said the action reflected significant deterioration in
capital structure and financial flexibility following Coleco's
111 mln dlr net loss in fiscal 1986. The agency attributed the
loss to a falloff in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls.
    Coleco had negative equity of 7.7 mln dlrs at year-end
1986, S/P noted. Future operating performance depends on
several new products with untested earnings potential.

<TITLE>ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegis Corp said it has created a
limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the
public.
    It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
September.
    The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
partnership.
   
    An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
    The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
    Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
    Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
    As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
spokesman said.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead
underwriters for to the public offering. The limited
partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf and Western Inc chairman Martin
Davis said the company will report record results for the
current fiscal year.
    In its last fiscal year ending October 31, the company
earned 228.7 mln dlrs, or 3.66 dlrs a share, on revenues of
2.093 billion dlrs.
    Earlier the company said its second quarter net rose to 86
cts a share from 73 cts a year ago. Davis said the company's
Paramount Pictures Corp had strong momentum, and a substantial
contribution is anticipated from the company's publishing
operations in the third and fourth quarter.
    Davis also said steady growth is expected in financial
services operations, bolstered by the acquisition in May of
Fruehauf's truck trailer financing and leasing business.
    He said the company's entertainment operations should
benefit significantly from Paramount's two major summer motion
pictures, "Beverly Hills Cop II," which grossed 65 mln dlrs in
its first 12 days of North American distribution, and "The
Untouchables," which opens June 3.

<TITLE>LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The current crude oil price of between
18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
officials said.
    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
World debt and industrialised nations.
    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
said.
    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
prices, he added.
    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major
crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
economists and money market dealers said.
    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
in the near future, they said.
    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
stable against the mark.
    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
opened a representative office, that the West German economy
was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
    "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
Lombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
around historical lows for West Germany.
    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.
    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
line with the new structure of money market rates since last
month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."
    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
    "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"
said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But I
don't expect any convincing measures," he said.
    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
month-end distortions.
    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
represent a tightening of policy, however.
    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
occupation this century.
    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
treated for minimum reserve purposes.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German government's independent
council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
Ost said.
    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
pct was achievable.
    It added the council believed "an intensification of the
already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
policy is not called for."
    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
increase.
    The government regularly uses the term "changed external
economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
could still fall below the 1986 level.
    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
    The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
position of the West German government ahead of next week's
seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

<TITLE>EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A former U.S. Agriculture Department
official urged the department to require that packages of
chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to
protect the public from disease.
    Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem
and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and
consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, "every
hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken
contaminated with salmonella."
    She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of
salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the
incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over
the past several years.
    Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of
Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind
consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.
    She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly
before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be
cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their
intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal
contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.
    Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation of
Government Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to
move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove
"disastrous." He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with
slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection
techniques should be overlaid.

    The rumour was cited by several market dealers as a factor
contributing to this afternoon's slide in share prices. The
FTSE 100 share index in late afternoon was down 7.4 points at
2,220.7, having earlier touched a new record of 2,248.8.
    Nationally, most polls put the Conservatives nine to 10

<TITLE>U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House has completed a new
review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not
yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last
April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
    But they also noted that the White House has said it was
unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.
    The officials added that while the curbs complicated
U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television
sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.
    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as
soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering
to the pact.

<TITLE>CSFB ECONOMIST SAYS VOCLKER'S RESIGNATION A SHOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The decision by Paul Volcker not to serve
a third term as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is a
shock for financial markets and the world economy, Hans Mast,
senior economic adviser to Credit Suisse First Boston, said.
    "The markets will believe there will be pressure for a more
expansive policy (in the United States)," he said.
    "I would say this is quite a shock for the world economy," he
added. "He always stood for an anti-inflationary policy and
tight fiscal discipline. He was one of the best central bankers
America has had."
    Mast said the markets would now be trying to assess what
sort of direction the Fed would be taking under Alan Greenspan,
designated to succeed Volcker.
    "Greenspan is more of a politician than an academician, but
the most important thing is that he has little experience in
banking," Mast said.
    Greenspan's first comments on being named were that the
dollar appeared to have bottomed out, but Mast said that
conviction would have to be backed by policy. "How can you say
the dollar has bottomed out with the present level of current
account deficits?" he said. "I would be sceptical."

<TITLE>ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the
Senate Energy Committee.
    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.
    "The area could contain potentially recoverable oil
resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly
equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides
almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said.
    He said production from the new section could begin about
the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000
without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.

to 60.629 billion crowns in May from 48.380 billion in April,
against 39.481 billion in May 1986, the Central Bank said in
its monthly balance sheet report.
    Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial
and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate
adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835
billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.
    The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions
accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May,
with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.
    "Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other
countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance
between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the
statement added.
    The Central Bank said that figures for private bank
reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and
there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.
    "It is therefore not possible on this basis to draw
conclusions about the developments of the external current
account," the statement added.

    Moody's said it would also evaluate Tandy's capital

of the retirement of about 250 mln dlrs of debt in the past
year. Under review are Tandy's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1
subordinated debt.

<TITLE>ITALIAN ECONOMISTS REGRET VOLCKER DECISION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading Italian economists said they
regretted Paul Volcker's decision not to serve another term as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
    Luigi Spaventa, Professor of Economics at Rome University,
told Reuters he thought the decision was a great loss to the
world's financial markets.
    "He (Volcker) was an element of reliability and stability
around world financial markets, a man of great experience,
balance and equilibrium," Spaventa said.
    Spaventa said it was difficult to gauge immediately what
Volcker's decision might mean for the dollar, but he noted that
the markets seemed to like Volcker.
     Mario Monti, Director of the Institute of Economics at
Milan's Bocconi University, told Reuters that "whoever succeeds
Volcker would face a formidable task because no central banker
has ever given such credibility to monetary policy and fighting
inflation."
    Monti said Alan Greenspan, who has been nominated to take
over from Volcker, was likely to pursue "a rigorous monetary
policy to demonstrate to the markets that there will be no loss
of credibility."
    Officials at the Bank of Italy and the Italian Treasury had
no comment on Volcker's decision.

by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to
move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand,
traders said.
    This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those
areas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a
tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against
recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.
    Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments
because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13
raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.
    A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July
New York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment,
traders said. But others said this was old business.

<TITLE>U.S. SPEAKER FEARS HIGHER RATES UNDER GREENSPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said he
was concerned that the appointment of Alan Greenspan to succeed
Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve Board would mean interest
rates would rise.
    Speaking to reporters, the Texas Democrat said that based
of Greenspan's tenure as chairman of President Nixon's Council
of Economic Advisers his policies would mean higher rates.
    "His previous service indicates the kind of economic
policies based on the trickle down theory rather than the
percolate up theory. This theory tends to higher interest
rates," Wright said.
    Wright told reporters he would not have chosen Greenspan to
head the Fed, but he declined to name his preference. "It would
be someone whose primary interest is in keeping interest rates
low. That is the national interest," he said.
    His main concern was that high interest rates have slowed
economic growth and held down the number of new jobs. The
United States needs "to reduce the level of interest rates so
this economy can get oxygen and breathe," Wright said.
    Wright said he had not talked with Greenspan about the
appointment.
    Asked to rate Volcker's tenure, he replied, "Long."

<TITLE>U.K. MERCHANT BANKS TO JOIN TOKYO EXCHANGE IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said satisfactory progress has been made in talks with Japan
that would lead to membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange for
three British merchant banks next year.
    Following weekend talks here between Japanese and British
officials Lawson told reporters "we have achieved our objective."
    The three applicants, &lt;Baring Brothers and Co Ltd>,
&lt;J.Henry Wagg and Co Ltd> and Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale Plc
&lt;KSLL.L>, would join "when the Stock Exchange has been extended,"
he said.
    The TSE has said this will be completed in May 1988. It has
repeatedly said it cannot accommodate any new members until
then because of limited space on its trading floor.
    During a visit to Tokyo in April, U.K. Corporate Affairs
Minister Michael Howard presented Japanese officials with what
he called a non-negotiable timetable for granting the three
British securities companies TSE membership.
    Howard said Britain expected a favourable response at last
weekend's meeting and wanted the firms to be made members
before next May. If Tokyo failed to act, Britain was ready to
retaliate against Japanese financial groups in London, he
added.
    Last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans to set
up a special committee to study the membership question.
    The committee is due to produce a report by the autumn.
This would allow the TSE to announce formally by the end of the
year who will be granted membership, although the companies
chosen would not be able to start trading until May.

<TITLE>HF AHMANSON &lt;AHM> ESTIMATES CUT BY GOLDMAN SACHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The stock of HF Ahmanson and Co fell
sharply after analyst Robert Hottensen of Goldman Sachs and Co
cut his earnings estimates of the savings and loan, traders
said.
    Ahmanson's stock fell 1-1/8 to 20-1/8 in active trading.
    Hottensen was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs said the reason for the reduction in earnings
estimates is the decline in demand for mortgage loans as
interest rates move higher. Mortgage rates moved to double
digits in april for the first time since last summer.
    The Goldman spokeswoman said that sales of adjustable rate
mortgages was a significant factor in Hottensen's original
earnings estimates.
    Last year, when the company's net income was 3.22 dlrs a
share, Ahmanson generated more than half of its 541 mln dlrs of
pretax income from gains on loan sales, the spokeswoman said.
    She said the reduction in earnings estimates to 2.60 dlrs a
share in 1987 from a previous estimate of 3.30 dlrs, reflects
less optimism with the mortgage loan environment.
    In the present environment for mortgages, the spokeswoman
said, Ahmanson's second quarter earnings should drop to 45 cts
a share from last year's 80 cts a share.
    Hottnesen expects the savings and loan to earn between 2.90
dlrs and 3.10 dlrs a share in 1988. he had previously estimated
earnings of 3.30 dlrs a share in 1988.

governors of the Federal Reserve System approved its
application to merge with (CentraBank Inc) of Baltimore,
expected to be completed July 1.
    The company said the board's approval included the
dismissal of a protest by the Baltimore-based Maryland Alliance
for Responsible Investing against NCNB's performance under the
Community Reinvestment Act.
   
    The company said Maryland Alliance wanted the merger
blocked on the grounds that NCNB inadequately served the credit

its markets.
    The company said it denied the claim.

<TITLE>LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BADEN, Switzerland, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank
president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of
achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A gradually
rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
regard to sustaining Swiss industry."
    "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," he
said.
    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
target of monetary stability.
    "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
policy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact no
persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
pct lower than the Swiss."
    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
long period of time.
    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
individual parities separately.
    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
    "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a
stronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwiler
said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY> MULLS SALE, RESTRUCTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares," the company said.
    The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
Stanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
investment in the company," the company said.
    Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
    The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an
average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in order
to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
(Ciba-Geigy) offer."
    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
    Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
    "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for
monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
    "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's
departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will
remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist
at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank
intervention in the open currency market.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK (RY.TO) RECLASSIFIES BRAZIL LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Bank of Canada said it classified
1.3 billion dlrs in medium and long-term loans to Brazil as
non-accrual, leading to a seven pct drop in second quarter
profit.
    "The designation of these loans as non-accrual reduced the
bank's earnings by about 22 mln dlrs after tax," chairman Allan
Taylor said in a statement. "Without this reduction,
second-quarter earnings would have been about 138 mln dlrs," a
10 pct increase over last year's profit, Taylor said.
    The bank earlier reported second quarter profit fell to
116.2 mln dlrs from 125.1 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The bank said domestic earnings rose to a record 125 mln
dlrs in the second quarter, a 52 mln dlr increase from the year
before, due to higher business volumes and securities gains as
well as a better yield from its domestic non-accrual loan
portfolio.
    It said international operations reported a net after-tax
loss of nine mln dlrs, compared with a 52 mln dlr profit last
year. The decline largely reflects the impact of Brazil's
suspended interest payments, which resulted in about a 40 mln
dlr reduction in net interest income, Royal Bank said.
    Royal Bank said it keeping its 1987 loan loss experience
estimate unchanged from the last quarter at one billion dlrs.
It said it is committed to building its general provision for
loan losses to at least 20 pct of total outstanding loans to
troubled sovereign borrowers by the end of 1989.
    The bank said non-accrual loans totalled 3.3 billion dlrs
at April 30--1.5 billion in domestic loans and 1.8 billion in
international loans. Excluding the 1.3 billion dlrs in loans to
Brazil, net non-accrual loans at the end of the second quarter
declined 200 mln dlrs over the 1987 first quarter, it said.

<TITLE>SMALL RISE SEEN IN U.S. GASOLINE INVENTORIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. analysts expect the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
    While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
    Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
prices, the analysts said.
    Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
continue at relatively high levels.
    Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
    Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
looks for a build said, "We have had five weeks of gasoline
demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.
    Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
   
    The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
    But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
    Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
to U.S. stocks.
    But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
runs.
    Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
discounted as having a market impact at this time.
    "A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"
one futures analyst said.
    Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels
reported by API for the week of may 22.
    The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added
to the nation's inventory.

    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
    Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
global demand.

    "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
originally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
    "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
    "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
economy," he added.
    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
    "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
agreement that had been reached between the United States and
Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
market.
    "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
agreement that it made become evident."
    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
trend on only one month's data.
    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
selling computer chips at below fair market value.
    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
problem.
    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
contain a major reduction.

sold the Commerce Meadows 600-site manufactured housing rental
community in Commerce Township, Michigan, for a pre-tax gain of
about 900,000 dlrs and the Heron Cay 610-site adult community

    The company said the sales proceeds will be partly used to
reduce debt. It said it is shifting its focus away from the
development of communities requiring significant equity and
having lengthy projected life cycles.
    The company also said along with local landowners and
investors, it will acquire 33-acre tract Northtowne Meadows in
the Toledo, Ohio, area for development into 160 home sites and
three acres of commercial land.
    Terms of the transactions and other parties involved were

<TITLE>ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Developing countries said the European
Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it
went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.
    Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the
exports of 26 ACP countries.
    They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures
laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations
between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect
trade between the two sides.
    They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking
not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current
Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held
under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.
    The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European
currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced
vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could
raise up to two billion Ecus a year.
    EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,
are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a
marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on
June 15.
    Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are
convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products
made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates
this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its
member country exports.
    "We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to
undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these
measures," Wilson said.
    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit
by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it
is approved.
    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only "as a very
last resort," but added that the ACP is in touch with other
countries which oppose the plan.
    Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear
Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not
export oils and fats.
    Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,
Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.

<DATELINE>    BONN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German officials said they could make
no comment on remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
who said Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers had agreed a
new process for economic coordination.
    At last year's G-7 summit in Tokyo, senior government
officials were requested to make a study of how economic data
could be better coordinated and the results of their work will
be presented at next week's summit in Venice.
    West Germany has said governments should not be obliged to
take economic steps purely in reaction to economic data.
    The U.S. Position on data coordination has been that
governments should react accordingly when economic indicators
fall short of expectations.
    The West German stance on coordination of data, which has
also been shared by the British government, has been a
potential threat to a joint stance by the G-7 on this topic.
    At a news conference in Washington, Baker would not be
specific about what agreement had been reached on data
coordination by the seven finance ministers.

<TITLE>BALLADUR UNDECIDED ON FUTURE, SPOKESMAN SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Edouard Balladur is
undecided over his future in office after next Spring's
presidential election, his spokesman said.
    "He (Balladur) has taken no definitive decision about his
activities in a year's time," his spokesman said in answer to a
Reuters question.
    He was responding to questions on a comment made by
Balladur, a close political associate of right wing Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac, in a radio interview.
    Balladur told a Radio Monte Carlo interviewer "From next
year I shall rediscover the freedom of private life."
    France is due to hold a presidential election in April or
May next year. Under the French political system, the prime
minister and his cabinet tender their resignation to the
incoming President, giving him freedom to appoint a new
government.
    Chirac, leader of a two-party coalition government is
widely assumed to be a presidential candidate, while incumbent
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand is tipped by most
opinion polls to win if he decides to stand again.
    Balladur's stringent economic policies have come under
increasing criticism inside and outside the coalition parties
in recent months as official statistics and forecasts have
shown slowing growth prospects and rising inflation.
    But the spokesman said Balladur was having no second
thoughts about the direction of his policies. "The Minister of
State (Balladur) has one current ambition, which is to achieve
his mission of national economic recovery," he said.
    "He refuses to prejudge the future a year from now."

<TITLE>GREENSPAN SEEN AS STRONG INFLATION FIGHTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donna Smith, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alan Greenspan, who has been nominated
to replace Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, is regarded by financial analysts as a conservative
economist who will take a strong stand against inflation.
    "He'll be a strong fighter against inflation," said Martin
Regalia, director of research and economics at the National
Council of Savings Institutions.
    Greenspan has broad experience both in running his own
private economic consulting firm - Townsend-Greenspan - and in
government service. He was President Ford's top economic
adviser, serving as chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers from September 1974 until January 1977.
    During that time, inflation rising above 10 percent, a was
a major political concern during Ford's administration.
    "He's had a lot of experience with inflation, and as an
inflation fighter," Richard Medley, partner with Smick-Medley
and Associates, said of Greenspan. "He had that seared into his
memory during that period," Medley added.

<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Skyline Explorations Ltd said expects
construction can begin next month on a gold mine at Johnny
Mountain Camp, located 600 miles north of Vancouver.
    The company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400
tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from
provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report,
"approval in principal," which is required before actual
construction can begin.
    Skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal
will be received in late June, by which time it expects to have
confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction
can begin in July.
   
    Skyline said the 1987 exploration drift on 16 vien east at
Johnny Mountain has advanced 320 feet. The vein is continuous,
averaging four feet thick plus an altered mineralized hanging
wall.
    It said periodic face samples indicate an average grade of
1.05 ounces per ton of ore ranging from a low of 0.78 ounce per
ton to a high of 55.8 ounces per ton.

<TITLE>SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nearby months in soybean and soymeal
futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of
livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the
new crop outlook bearish, traders said.
    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"
one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.
    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
another two cents today to 10 over July futures.
    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing
to sell, dealers said.
    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
of the Midwest.
    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the
spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.
    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July
soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has
already moved to a premium over the August through October
months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also
move to a July premium later this month, they added.

    In its annual report on the mortgage insurance industry,
Moody's said that in 1986 incurred losses increased by 21 pct

    Moody's said the underwriting losses mainly reflected major

insurance industry risk remains high, slow improvement appears
likely.

<TITLE>KAUFMAN SAYS GREENSPAN NOMINATION BAD FOR BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Henry Kaufman, managing director of
Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan
Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and
currency markets.
    "The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The
fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,
interrupted by intermittent rallies," Kaufman said in a
statement. He said the implication for equity markets in
neutral to bullish.
    Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office
of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both
domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to
demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before
he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."
    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.
economy, while his professional skills in the international
area are much more limited, Kaufman noted.
    "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views
on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially
carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."

<TITLE>MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
several days before repairs are made and the system is
functioning again.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
more days to complete.
    "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
assess because of flooding on the Red River.
    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
    Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
customers to determine their requirements.
    Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.
    Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been
closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on
New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20
cts a barrel.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lac Minerals Ltd reiterated it expected
substantially higher 1987 profit and revenues than last year's
earnings of 19.1 mln dlrs on 250.2 mln dlrs of revenues.
    The 1986 results include the disputed Page-Williams mine at
Hemlo, Ontario. A decision is imminent on Lac's appeal of a
1986 Ontario court decision ordering Lac to hand over the mine
to International Corona Resources Ltd &lt;ICR.TO>.
    Lac chief executive Peter Allen told institutional
investors that the anticipated stronger performance would come
from strong operating results and an active revenue management
program.
   
    Lac said year-to-date gold production excluding the
disputed Page-Williams mine was 134,000 ounces, in line with
targeted 1987 production of 300,000 ounces. It said it expected
an average realized price of 450 U.S. dlrs an ounce in
full-year 1987.
    It said its outstanding forward contracts at May 29 were
220,000 ounces of gold at average price of 439 U.S. dlrs an
ounce, including 135,000 ounces maturing in 1987 at 482 U.S.
dlrs an ounce.

<TITLE>CHICAGO PACIFIC &lt;CPA> TO REPURCHASE NOTES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Pacific Corp chairman Harvey
Kapnick told analysts that he expects within the next year to
repurchase about 25 mln dlrs of the company's 200 mln dlr issue
of 14 pct subordinated notes.
    To date the company has repurchased about 60 mln of these
notes.
    "This will have a beneficial effect on our net income but
the effects in 1987 have already been anticipated in estimates
for 1987," Kapnick said.
    Earlier, Kapnick said that analysts' 1987 projections of 31
to 35 mln dlrs or 3.10 dlrs to 3.40 dlrs for earnings for
operations are reasonable. These compare to 2.30 dlrs or 22 mln
dlrs for 1986.
    Since November 1985, Chicago Pacific has acquired the
&lt;Hoover Co> and &lt;Rowenta>, both appliance companies and
furniture companies &lt;Kippinger/Pennsylvania House Group Inc> 
and the &lt;McGuire Co>.
    The company spent a total of 724.8 mln dlrs on
acquisitions.
   
    "We believe our balance sheets provides us with about 300
mln dlrs for future acquisitions,"  Kapnick said.
    Kapnick also said he expects sales of the company's
appliance division to increase 17 pct from the 915.7 mln dlrs
reported in 1986.
    Kapnick further said the 67 mln dlrs of trademarks and
patents will be reduced to 40 mln dlrs due to net loss
carryforwards of acquired companies which were offset against
these assets as required by current accounting principles.

an initial public offering of Noranda Forest shares.
   
    Zimmerman told Reuters that he agrees with one forest
industry analyst's prediction that Noranda Forest will earn at
least 165 mln dlrs in 1987.
    Noranda Forest's preliminary share prospectus, released
today, shows the company had 1986 pro forma earnings of 80.2
mln dlrs, excluding a 22.5 mln dlr extraordinary gain.
    Asked to comment on the analyst's forecast that Noranda
could earn about 200 mln dlrs this year, Zimmerman said, "I
think that he is directionally very correct."
    He also said Noranda Forest will consolidate financial
results of 50 pct-owned MacMillan Bloedel Ltd &lt;MB.TO>.
    Zimmerman said Noranda Forest expects to raise at least 350
mln dlrs from its first share issue, making it one of Canada's
largest initial public offerings.
    Noranda Forest intends to issue about 15 pct of its common
shares to the public at first, but parent company Noranda Inc
"is prepared to let up to 49 pct of it go into the public hands,"
he added. Noranda Inc now holds all of the 79.9 mln outstanding
shares of Noranda Forest.
    Zimmerman declined to say when future secondary share
offerings might occur, although he said they will be made "as
soon as it's right" for either cash or other securities.
    Proceeds from the share issue will be used mainly to reduce
Noranda Forest's long term debt, listed pro forma as 1.36
billion dlrs at the end of first quarter, 1987, chairman
Zimmerman said.
    Noranda Forest's first priority will be to continue cutting
debt to "a comfortable, manageable level in all likely future
circumstances" or about 30 pct of capital, he said.
    "I think we learned last time around that although your
assets can support a high levels of debt, earnings can't
support associated interest in times of high interest rates,"
Zimmerman commented.
    Noranda Forest had pro forma operating losses of 8.6 mln
dlrs in 1985 and 2.9 mln dlrs in 1984 during periods of higher
interest rates.
    The company's pro forma 1987 first quarter results showed
net profit of 42.2 mln dlrs or 49 cts a share, up from earnings
of 4.7 mln dlrs or one ct a share, excluding a 22.5 mln dlr
extraordinary gain, in the prior year.
    Zimmerman also said the company will concentrate on
maintaining quality earnings from existing operations rather
than increasing operating volumes. "We are likely to spend money
to enhance our operations ahead of expanding them," he said.
    Noranda Forest would also be interested in buying the 50
pct interest it does not already own in Northwood Pulp and
Timber Ltd from Mead Corp &lt;MEA> for between 150 mln and 200 mln
dlrs, Zimmerman said.
    Noranda Forest and Mead each have the right of first
refusal the other's Northwood holding, but Mead likely is not
anxious to sell, he added.
    Noranda Forest's initial dividend policy will be to pay 10
cents a share quarterly. When asked, Zimmerman agreed the
dividend was small compared to cash flow, adding the company
will later "establish a typical or sensible dividend policy."

a share in cash, 4.50 dlrs in subordinated debentures and a 1/4

<TITLE>OVERSEAS &lt;OSG> SEES OPEC QUOTAS KEY TO RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
accordingly.
    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
improvement in tanker rates.
    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
   
    He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
ago.
    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
or 1.45 dlrs per share.
   
    "The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
markets last summer," Hyman said.
    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
    Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

would supply manufacturers of PVC construction and other

    Theys said the  plant would cost about 125 mln Canadian

differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,
and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and
spot to December arrival/delivery.
    The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or
June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate
carrying costs will be taken into account.
    The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
of offers emanating from the origins.
    The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif
landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights"
to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00
pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said.
    No more than four offers will be considered from each
offering party, it added.

<DATELINE>    LYON, France, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two people were missing and six
injured after tanks containing thousands of cubic metres of
fuel burst into flames today at a Shell storage unit in Lyon,
rescue workers said.
    The blaze broke out with an explosion around 1330 local
time (1130 GMT). Shell is a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD>.
    Some 200 firemen fought the flames at the gasoline storage
unit at Edouard Herriot riverside port complex and appeared to
have the blaze under control as night fell. The entire southern
section of Lyon was cordoned off.
    The fire destroyed five giant tanks and threatened four
others, the Shell spokesman said. He said that the company
estimated between six and seven thousand cubic metres of
domestic fuel oil, gasoline and additives had been burned.
    The total capacity of the burning tanks was over 10,000
cubic metres, but some had been empty when an explosion started
today's fire, he added.

received a revision to one of the two previously disclosed
proposals to buy the company.
    Pay 'N Pak said that the proposal from a leveraged buyout
firm had been amended to increase the dividend rate on the
cumulative preferred stock to be received by PNP shareholders
from 13.5 pct to 17.5 pct.
    As previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a
transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a
combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation
value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Under the other proposal received from Paul Bilzerian, PNP
shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in
cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative
redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company
said.
    Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the
preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of
the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to
Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation
value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. military forces in the Mideast
Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and
occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to
"non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.
    "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said
as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the
protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.
    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.
    "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are
under our protection with the exception, on a limited
case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military
Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
region," Sims said.
    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti
ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and
Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that
the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the
U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian
charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.
    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.
    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its
seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11
Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional
ships and air cover are under consideration.

<TITLE>CONGRESSMAN QUESTIONS INSIDER TRADING ENFORCEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said Dennis
Levine's conviction for insider trading showed the need for
tougher enforcement of insider trading laws by the government
and the securities industry.
    Lent's comments came at the start of closed testimony by
Levine at the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee.
Levine's testimony was not released.
    "Why didn't Dennis Levine's superiors at four different
investment banking houses question the sources of his 'uncanny'
information on possible corporate takeovers?" Lent asked.
    "Why has the Securities and Exchange Commission historically
been unable to prosecute insider trading cases without outside
evidence that illegal behavior has taken place?" Lent added.
    Lent said Levine had told the subcommittee staff his
associates at major banks told him insider trading was accepted
practice. Levine also said he did not worry about being caught
by the SEC.
    "The securities industry must stop putting morality and
ethics behind proift. The SEC must exercise tougher control and
supervision of the industry," Lent said.

    Cut were the company's senior debt to AA-minus from AA,
subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus and preferred stock
to A from A-plus. S/P affirmed its A-1-plus commercial paper.
    The downgrade reflected a modest increase in Norstar's risk
profile, combined with lower financial performance. Norstar's
recent purchase of the 1.2 billion dlr Syracuse Savings Bank
will require substantial management and financial resources to
bring the unit's performance in line with the bank's other
operations, the agency said.

<TITLE>U.K. BANKERS LAUD VOLCKER, UNSURE ABOUT GREENSPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MARGUERITE NUGENT, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Bankers for the most part lauded
outgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his
achievements over the past eight years but expressed some
uncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan, nominated by
President Reagan to succeed him.
    "One of Volcker's greatest achievements was the sense of
continuity and stability he gave to the international markets,"
said Carlos Santistevan, executive director of Libra Bank Plc.
However, it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan to
fill that role and the degree to which he can do so, he said.
    Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm,
Townesend, Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration.
    "He is a prominent and well known figure in the U.S." said
David Lomax, Group Economics Adviser at National Westminster
Bank Plc, who described Greenspan as an "orthodox Republican
economist" who may be better suited to getting the U.S. Economy
on track than Volcker.
    But for the most part bankers in London are unfamiliar with
Greenspan's views on domestic and international economics or
the international debt crisis.
    "I will be sad to see Volcker go. He is a central banker of
good repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And
international banking system," said Libra's Santistevan.
    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted
countries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as
familiar with the problem and the personalities involved.
    For this reason he expects there will be little change in
the Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercial
banks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding
billions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on
third world debt.
    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American
debt problem also doubted there would be much change
post-Volcker, but for other reasons.
    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's
debt initiative which called for greater contributions by
banks, governments and multilateral organization, government's
have done little to try to improve the situation, leaving the
bulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.
    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, he
questioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the
job so close to the next Presidential election.
    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the
financial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on
foreign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank
intervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover
somewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one
point, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost
more than one point.
    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds Bank
Plc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the
announcement was well-timed, given the recent rise in the
dollar against the mark and yen.
    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar
has fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today
announcing his nomination Greenspan said "there certainly is
evidence" that the dollar had bottomed out.
    However, many economists here believe that the recent rise
in the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to
fall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to
reverse.
    "The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a few
years" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important
thing is that there is a soft landing.
    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hear
Greenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.
    "He has everything going for him but he must establish
credibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and the
outlook for interest rates," he said.
    Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard a
stance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when his
tightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates to
record levels.
    "He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and only
relaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted
(in 1982)," National Westminster's Lomax said.
    Lomax said that Greenspan, if appointed, will inherit the
agreements entered into by Volcker with other members of the
Group of Five industrial nations on the dollar.
    However, he said that the danger lies in dollar stability
being maintained because of a monetary policy that is too
tight. Too firm a monetary policy could send the U.S. Into
recession, which would not be welcome by European counterparts,
he said.

<TITLE>HOLLLINGER &lt;HLG.TO> PAYING 50 MLN DLRS FOR BUY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
annual meeting, confirming a published report.
    Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
Black said, "That would not be wildly inaccurate," although he
declined to disclose the actual cost.
    Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
Ontario and Quebec.
    Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
dailies.
    "There is really no end to the ones that are available," he
told reporters, although he added that most remaining
acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
quarter.
   
    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
dlrs last year.
    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
Independent daily newspaper.
   
    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
Guardian.
    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
   
    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
figures were not disclosed.
    He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss
was sharply reduced from last year.

<TITLE>REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan called for continued
nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United
States in the face of congressional opposition because of the
Bucharest government's record on human rights.
    A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for
continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for
Romania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "all
options were seriously considered."
    But the statement said that despite concerns about human
rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had
decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on
human rights practices there.
    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress
requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary
and China.
    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill
legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending
certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on
human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN
for Hungary and China.

<TITLE>NO PROSPECT IN SIGHT OF EC BUDGET ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community was set to
plunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministers
failed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in the
near-bankrupt Community's finances, diplomats said.
    As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks in
Luxembourg, diplomats said there was little basis for an accord
amongst the trading bloc's 12 member states.
    The EC executive Commission says the Community faces a
deficit this year of at least five billion European Currency
Units and could be forced to choose between massive spending
cuts or bankruptcy.
    It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5
billion ECUs to help meet the deficit, caused by soaring farm
spending and falling revenues.
    But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted that
there can be no extra cash for the Community this year and
instead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbs
two thirds of the EC budget.
    "We have to make clear that expenses should be based on
income," West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer told
reporters.
    "There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financing
in the form of national contributions," he added.
    A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of the
budget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than in
advance for their spending on Community farm policies, was also
far from agreement, diplomats added.
    The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany,
would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed for
two months.
    But poorer member states, which would have to borrow funds
to cover the delay, complain the change in the system would
unfairly impose too much of the burden on them.
    The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an early
debate on the changeover in the farm payments system, further
delaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentary
sources said.

<TITLE>DATA GENERAL &lt;DGN> SEES LITTLE SALES UPTURN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Data General Corp said sales continue to
remain flat and it sees little evidence that demand will pick
up in the near future.
    The company had not "really seen any major change" in
demand, vice president of group marketing, J. David Lyons, told
Reuters in an interview. "Our sales have been moderate to flat,
but certainly not down," Lyons said.
    Data General president Edson de Castro declined to comment
on his outlook for the computer industry or on the company's
performance.
   
    Wall Street analysts said they were not surprised by the
less than confident message from Data General which earlier
today announced computer networking products to link personal
computers with networks of its minicomputers and computers from
other vendors.
    "They've tried a number of different things that haven't
seemed to work," said Paine Webber analyst Stephen Smith. "Data
General is finding that aggressive pricing alone isn't enough"
to win sales," Smith said.
    In the second quarter ended March 31, Data General posted
an operating loss of 24.4 mln dlrs, or 91 cts a share, compared
to earnings of 2.0 mln dlrs, or eight cts a share, a year
earlier. Sales for the quarter fell to 315.2 mln dlrs from
318.8 mln dlrs.
    Despite reports of an upturn in sales at rivals Digital
Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> and International Business Machines Corp
&lt;IBM>, Data General said it was not convinced that the
minicomputer market had emerged from a two-year slump.
    "We would rather wait until we see a sustained improvement
in orders," Lyons said.
   
    Lyons said new hardware and software introduced by the
company are a response to customers who want to tie together
their growing number of PCs and to connect them with larger
mini and mainframe computers.
    He said the products are part of a new strategy of
providing industry-standard systems that allow computers from
different vendors to share and exchange information.
   
    Analysts noted that Data General is one of many companies
promoting the integration of PCs with other office computers.
    "PC integration is a tough strategy," said Smith.
    "A lot of people are coming to the market from a lot of
different angles," he said.

billion dlr money bill for the rest of fiscal 1987 ending
October 1.
    The Senate voted 64 to 32 to override objections the bill's
money total violated the 1987 budget, a vote that required 60
votes for approval.
    The House-passed measure, debated by the Senate since May
7, carries funds for most government activities with the bulk
--6.7 billion dlrs--for agriculture support programs.
    Final passage could come late tonight or tomorrow.

<TITLE>LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
-- effectively making them American ships.
    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
    The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some producers in the 1987 acreage
reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92
pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted
with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster
Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
permitted acreage.
    A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July
15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when
applications are being accepted, it said.
    The department said producers of wheat other than winter
wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home
Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that
occurred in 1986.

<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BANK SAYS NO SUPPORT FOR VW MANAGEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, West Germany, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's biggest
bank said it would withhold support from Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>
management at next month's annual meeting because of the VW
currency scandal.
    Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> said it would abstain in votes
exonerating VW management and the supervisory board, which
represents shareholders and employees, unless an auditor's
report on the currency scandal is published before the July 2
annual meeting and either clearly absolves or blames the
management and board.
    Several shareholder groups have said they will vote against
management at what promises to be a stormy annual meeting. If a
majority of shareholders back these groups, the top management
of Europe's biggest carmaker could be dismissed.
    Deutsche said it expected the results of the auditor's
report on the currency fraud, which cost VW some 260 mln dlrs,
to be published before the annual meeting.
    But in a letter to Deutsche customers depositing their VW
shares at the bank, Deutsche wrote: "Without knowledge of these
results, we do not think we are in a position to make you a
suggestion for or against exoneration of the management board
and supervisory board."
    "Unless you give us instructions to the contrary, we will
abstain with your shares ... but we reserve the right to vote
for or against exoneration of the management board and
supervisory board, if this seems in your interest in line with
the results of the auditor's report," it added.
    A strong shareholder vote against the management would
empower the supervisory board to dismiss the management if it
chooses, though such a move would not be mandatory.
    A member of the supervisory board who does not receive
exoneration at an annual meeting may have to step down.
    An abstention or no-vote by banks on behalf of customers
against management would in itself be a vote of no confidence.
    German banks traditionally use their huge proxy votes at
annual meetings to support the management of the company, in
which they are often represented on the supervisory board.
    VW management board chairman Carl Hahn said in April that
1986 profits had been hit by the scandal, in which documents
relating to currency arbitrage were allegedly faked, but
profits for 1987 would not be affected.
    Following the scandal, finance director Rolf Selowsky
resigned, and former chief dealer Bobby Junger was arrested.
    Deutsche represents 8-10 pct of VW's share capital, the
sources said, and F. Wilhelm Christians, one of the bank's two
management board spokesmen (chief executives) is on the VW
supervisory board.
    Banking sources said Deutsche was furious with VW after the
bank led an international placement of VW shares from the
company's record rights issue last September.
    Less than two months later VW announced a sharp fall in
interim profits, bashing its share price and severely denting
confidence in the German share market generally.
    A spokesman for the Savings Bank Association said that
German savings banks would vote not to discharge Selowsky, and
depending on whether the auditor's report was published would
abstain on the vote for other management board members.
    The federal government and the state of Lower Saxony
together have 40 pct of VW shareholders' votes. It is still
unclear how they will vote. Associations representing small
shareholders will also ensure the annual meeting is heated.
    The Protective Association for Securities Ownership has
said it will vote against the entire management board, and the
Protective Society for Small Shareholders will also vote
against the supervisory board.
    A spokeswoman for Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG, the
auditors commissioned by VW in March to investigate the
scandal, declined to comment when its report would be issued.

<TITLE>PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good
fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
for the metal.
    In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham
said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last
month.
    "Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
of our trucks," he said, referring to tightness of supply and
strong demand. "The fundamentals are good."
   
    Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;
"All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."
    He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on
record behind 1984, he said.
    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
   
    During the interview, executive vice president Douglas
Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
the copper price rose "because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly."
    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound
rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
Phelps Dodge, the company said.
    "Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
and other areas," Yearley said.
   
    New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine
owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's
&lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's
own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production
shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.
    Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located
Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The
company's total production costs, including depreciation but
before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a
pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.

CBS Inc &lt;CBS> and 20th Century-Fox Film Corp, expects revenues
for 1987 to exceed 400 mln dlrs, up from 361 mln dlrs last
year, President James Fifield said in an interview.
    Despite a leveling out of video recorder sales, Fifield
sees strong international business for the producer and
marketer of prerecorded videocassettes. He also said expansion
into non-theatrical products is bolstering results.
    Fifield was in Chicago to attend the summer Consumer
Electronics Show.
    CBS/Fox Video projects the industry will sell about 116 mln
units with a total manufacturers value of 3.3 billion dlrs.
    Fifield told Reuters his company will introduce "at least
20 of our best titles" in the fall to accommodate the new
Compact Disc-Video system.
    He also said CBS/Fox will support the new S-VHS, or Super
VHS high-resolution format with titles to match demand.

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT IN SENEGAL MARKET -- USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>After a highly favorable reception of
a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour
last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the
department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
delaying deliveries.
    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

<TITLE>SEARS &lt;S> DOWNGRADED BY E.F. HUTTON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sears, Roebuck and Co's stock was
downgraded one notch from a neutral rating, said E.F. Hutton
analyst Bernard Sosnick.
    The company's stock closed at 50, off 1-1/4.
    Sosnick said "sluggish sales cloud the economic picture and
concern about the outlook for credit income diminish Sears'
near-term investment prospects." He said the retail sales in
May were weak, which would mean sales have been below plan for
the past two months.
    Sosnick said indications are that Sears may not be as
strong a performer as other retailers.
    However, he said his earnings estimate for the company for
1987 remains unchanged at 4.50 dlrs a share compared to 3.62
dlrs a share in 1986. He added that "as a result of weakening
sales momentum, we have less confidence in that estimate."
    The analyst said it projects second quarter earnings in the
1.05 to 1.10 dlrs a share range, up from 77 cts a year ago. The
1987 estimate includes an 18 ct a share gain from the sale of
50 savings bank branches and strong earnings contribution from
Allstate Insurance.

<TITLE>VOLCKER LEAVING DESPITE REAGAN REQUESTS TO STAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paul Volcker's departure as Federal
Reserve Board chairman came despite pleas from the Reagan
administration that he stay at the helm of the U.S. central
bank, U.S. officials said.
    "The President made it very clear that he would be very,
very pleased had the chairman's decision been otherwise,"
Treasury Secretary James Baker said.
    A Reagan administration official, who asked not to be
identified, said Baker too had urged Volcker repeatedly in the
past several months to consider staying on as chairman.
    But there were no indications the administration had told
Volcker that it was in the national interest for him to stay
and that current global economic uncertainties required it.
    Associates of Volcker have assumed Volcker would only have
stayed on in such circumstances. "He doesn't care a lot,
emotionally, about a third term," Nikko Securities vice-chairman
Stephen Alixrod, until last year a top Fed staffer, told
Reuters recently.
    Officials are confident that newly-nominated chairman Alan
Greenspan will re-establish close working relations with Baker
and his credentials eventually will calm markets.
    One Reagan administration economic policymaker, who asked
not to be named, pointed out that Baker and Greenspan worked
together closely in the Ford administration.
    At the time, Baker was acting Secretary of Commerce and
Greenspan headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
    Reagan administration officials made clear, meanwhile, that
the announcement, precipitated by Volcker's unshakeable
decision to quit, came in order to clear up uncertainty ahead
of the Summit of leading industrial democracies in Venice.
    President Reagan might have been in an embarrassing
position if no decision had been made by then.
    Volcker enjoys the respect of most top economic officials
abroad, and is admired at the West German Bundesbank, and in
Tokyo, despite his criticism  of Japanese policies.
    Financial markets, possibly reflecting some of the
disappointment in foreign capitals, drove the dollar sharply
lower on news of his departure, prompting central bank
intervention to stem the fall, dealers said.
    Finance Ministries and central banks of the other summit
nations -- Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada -- were informed shortly before the news was announced,
Baker told reporters today.
    Monetary sources also said one reason Volcker decided to
resign was his personal financial situation and his marriage 
-- his wife lives in New York and did not want him to take up a
second term in mid-1983.
    Volcker has foregone potentially million-dollar salaries to
a life almost overwhelmingly devoted to public service at pay
rates low relative to his financial commitments.
    Both these reasons at one time prompted him to consider
stepping down before his second term was completed.
    But Volcker also hinted there might be more than personal
reasons for his decision. "It was a personal decision, taking
account of a lot of things, including purely personal
considerations and others," he told reporters.
    Fed sources note Volcker's considerable unease at the lack
of progress by the administration in reaching a budget deficit
reduction agreement.
    In addition, Volcker would have faced four more years with
a Board that he was less than comfortable with, monetary
sources say. The other five members are Reagan appointees.
    What may unsettle markets, however, is the fact that the
Fed governors now have only six to seven years' collective
experience between them, at a time of great financial
uncertainty.
    Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be considered
as tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker, his Republican
credentials could make him more of a political Fed chairman
than Volcker.
    An administration official said Volcker was consulted on
Greenspan "and very much approved of his replacement."
    But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to the
administration, to whom he has been an unofficial economic
adviser, with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns had
with the Nixon administration.
    Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration
viewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing to
make radical policy changes.
    Making clear his decision was a strong one, Volcker told
reporters, "I told (Reagan) with considerable definitiveness
yesterday." Administration officials said Volcker arrived at the
White House yesterday afternoon with his resignation.
    When renominated in mid-1983, Volcker said he would
probably step down within two years. Monetary sources said the
departure of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor
that convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almost
from the start of the administration.
    Another, these sources said, was the prospect of being able
to work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle the
international debt crisis and deal with the then high-flying
dollar.

<TITLE>AHMANSON &lt;AHM> TO TAKE 2ND QTR WRITEOFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.F. Ahmanson and Co said second
quarter earnings will include the write-off of the company's 24
mln dlr investment in the Federal Savings and Loans Insurance
Corporation.
    The company also said it will postpone planned second
quarter sales of up to one billion dlrs of adjustable rate
mortgage-backed securities because secondary market premiums
have temporarily contracted.
   
    It said the write-off will reduce net earnings for the
quarter and year by about 13 cents per share and the
postponement of securities sales will defer about 30 cts per
share of profits to subsequent quarters.
    The company said the write-off of the FSLIC asset was
prompted by a recent General Accounting Office report that
declared the FSLIC technically insolvent.
    The company said it also received a letter from the FSLIC
informing Ahmanson that it will not honor its long-standing
obligation to Ahmanson's Home Savings of America unit, as well
as to hundreds of other thrifts.
   
    The company said the letter stated that Ahmanson's
investment should be written off in May.
    The company reported second quarter net income last year of
76.6 mln dlrs, or 80 cts per share. Ahmanson reported 1986 net
income of 303.6 mln dlrs, or 3.22 dlrs per share.

<TITLE>INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>With more private investment, not more
protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
congressional agencies said today.
    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
optimism than a few years ago.
    "While textile producers are making significant
investments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
retaliation.
    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
profits and investments of domestic firms.
    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
Asian textile producing countries.
    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
expected to be voted on in the House this year.
    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
markets, Kelly said.
    He added that private investment in the textile and
clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

<TITLE>BANK OF CANADA WELCOMES GREENSPAN APPOINTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Canada, the country's central
bank, believes economist Alan Greenspan was a sound choice to
replace retiring U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, a
spokesman for the bank said.
    "Mr. Greenspan is well known to the bank. He's had a lot of
experience. He's very capable, and with Mr. Volcker's decision
not to seek reappointment, he's a sound choice," said Roy
Flett, associate secretary for the bank.
    Flett said, "the Bank of Canada has enjoyed an excellent
relationship with Mr. Volcker during his terms and has only the
greatest respect for his performance."
    Economists said the appointment was extremely important to
Canada because the country's monetary policy is closely linked
with that of the U.S.
    "Basically, we have chosen ... to march in lockstep with
U.S. monetary policy, so really in some sense this is our
central banker that has just been appointed as well," said Mike
McCracken, head of Infometrica Ltd.

<TITLE>PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert
Durham said the company is prepared to make another large
non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
near future.
    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was
examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
    He declined to name the companies but said a deal could
occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
   
    Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals
Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
among other products.
    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
operations.
    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about
100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
   
    Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly
deal, he added.
    "We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
about a perfume company," he said. "We want a good basic
industrial company that will fit into our management
structure," Durham said.
   
    During the interview, Durham and other executives also said
continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
higher prices for the metal.
    "In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly," said executive vice president
Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of
producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50
cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts
said.
    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
    He declined to project results for the second quarter or
year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
copper prices in the last month will help results.
    Durham said last month that the second quarter should match
the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
dlrs or 49 cts a share.
    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased
copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also
acquired last year.
    Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>LILLY &lt;LLY> TO PAY ROCHE ROYALTIES ON HUMATROPE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hoffman-LaRoche Inc said Eli Lilly and
Co Inc will pay it royalties on the sale of Lilly's human
growth hormone, Humatrope, as part of an earlier-reported
licensing agreement between the companies.
    Hoffman-La Roche spokesman John Doorley declined to
disclose the amount of the royalty payments.
    "Lilly has taken the position of respecting our patent by
paying us roylaties," said Doorley. "We are hopeful that other
companies will respect that position," he said.
    Roche is the licensee of a Hormone Research Foundation
patent for a synthetic version of human growth hormone.
   
    Last September, Roche and the Foundation sued Genetech Inc
&lt;GENE> alleging Genetech's product, Protropin, a human growth
hormone, infringed on Hoffman's patent for the hormone.
    Last year Genetech's sales of Protropin were about 35 mln
dlrs. David Saks, drug analyst with Morgan Olmstead, Kennedy
and Gardner in New York, said Genetech's and Lilly's product
can each bring in about 50 mln dlrs in sales annually.
    Other companies developing human growth hormone include
Biotechnology General Corp. Roche's Doorley said the company
had at one time started developing a growth hormone but decided
to put its efforts into other products.

<TITLE>MERCANTILE &lt;MTRC.O> RAISES RESERVE, SEES LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mercantile Bancorp Inc said it will add
a special provision of 75 mln dlrs to its reserve for possible
loan losses in the second quarter, and expects to report a loss
of 33 mln dlrs during the period.
    The company estimated it will report net income of two mln
dlrs during the full year 1987.
    Mercantile Bancorp said the additional provision represents
28.5 pct of Mercantile Bancorp's 263 mln dlrs in total
outstanding loans to Latin American countries. The special
provision will raise the reserve to 148 mln dlrs, or 3.1 pct of
the company's 4.7 billion dlrs total loans.
    Mercantile Bancorp earned 19.5 mln dlrs in last year's
second quarter, or 1.23 dlrs a share, and 55.6 mln dlrs, or
3.50 dlrs a share for the full year 1986.
    Mercantile Bancorp's reaffirmed its intention to continue
the present dividend and to follow its normal policy of basing
future dividends on anticipated earnings from ongoing business.
    "It now appears the adjustment process for heavily indebted
countries could stretch into the 1990's, and these
restructurings may have negative economic effects on the loan
portfolio," Mercantile Bancorp said.

<DATELINE>    EDMONTON, Alberta, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco
Canada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-
Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit
Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible
commercial development of Alberta's oilsands.
    Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands
conference that "Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the
Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and
determination to make that solution work."
    The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian
nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.
    Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share
offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of
the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
    He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in
Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five
years after the acquisition.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. House of Representatives 
approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not
place any restrictions on its actions.
    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
effectively making them American ships.
    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
    It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
formulating policy.
    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE TEAM WANTS MULTINATIONAL GULF FORCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing
American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored
a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.
    Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a
Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in
the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if
the U.S. upgraded its defense role.
    The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates,
their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan
administration plans to let half of Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet
fly the U.S. flag.
    Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should
explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force.
    "The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now
talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this
arrangement," Warner said.
    Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively
deployed within 24 hours of a decision.
    Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations
multinational force, or failing that, an American, British,
French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.
    Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the
situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. "And,
unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said
that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula."

<TITLE>ABRAMS SAYS HE "HONEST BUT WRONG"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams said he was "completely honest and completely wrong" when
he gave assurances last October that the U .S. government was
not involved in a flight by a contra supply plane downed over
Nicaragua.
    He was being questioned by the congressional Iran-contra
panel about testimony he gave to the House Foreign Affairs
Committee on October 15, 1986, saying no U.S. intelligence,
defense or other government official was involved in the
flight.
    "I made those statements and I made a similar statement on
October 14 to Secretary (of State George) Shultz. And every one
of those statements was completely honest and completely wrong,"
Abrams testified.
    Two of the crew of the downed aircraft, operating out of El
Salvador, were killed. The third, Eugene Hasenfus, was
captured, tried and sentenced to 30 years' jail, but later
released by the Nicaraguan authorities.
    Abrams -- the highest-ranking member of the administration
to testify in five weeks of televised hearings -- said he did
not remember how he learned that the plane had been shot down,
but thought it was probably from the CIA.
    He said he made public statements within a couple of days
that there had been no U.S. government involvement after making
inquiries of the CIA, the National Security Council and the
Pentagon.
    "Everybody said, not only then but later, that there was no
U.S. government role," he said.

<TITLE>CONISTON ASKS DOT TO REVIEW ALLEGIS-BOEING DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A New York investment partnership
seeking control of Allegis Corp &lt;AEG> disclosed that it has
asked the Department of Transportation to review a 700 mln dlr
note agreement Allegis has with Boeing Co &lt;BA>.
    Citing what it called serious competitive and public
interest concerns in the deal, Coniston Partners, which holds
about 13 pct of Allegis asked the department to assert its
jurisdiction in the matter and require the two companies to
seek its approval for the transaction.
    In a petition to the department, contained in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coniston also claims
Boeing, a major aircraft manufacturer, has obtained control
over Allegis, parent of United Airlines, by virtue of the May
12 deal between the two companies.
    Under the deal, Boeing bought from Allegis 700 mln dlrs of
convertible notes due May 31, 1992 simultaneously with a 2.1
billion dlr aircraft order United placed with Boeing.
    Coniston said the notes give Boeing control over Allegis
and warned that the relationship between the two companies
raises antitrust issues and should be scrutinized closely.
    "The world's largest manufacturer of aircraft should not be
permitted to acquire control over one of the nation's largest
airlines without an opportunity for public comment and fact
finding and scrutiny by the regulatory agency having
jurisdiction over the air transporation marketplace," Coniston
said in its petition.
    Coniston, calling itself the Allegis Investors Group in the
petition, said the department should force Allegis and Boeing
to make the required regulatory filings.
    Coniston is currently seeking control of Allegis by winning
majority representation on its board of directors.

<TITLE>COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Colombian group announced the suspension
of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy
of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln
dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>.
    There was no indication the government would meet the
conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army
(ELN).
    According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried
out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.
    The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have
caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.
    In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one
dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a
condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.
    Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per
day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating
Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.
    If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up
to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the
penalty.

<TITLE>CFTC CLARIFIES COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) released guidelines on how commodity trading
advisors (CTA) should calculate "beginning net asset value"
(BNAV) for purposes of computing rates of return required by
commission disclosure rules.
    The commission said it was compelled to release the
guidelines because it has received disclosure documents which
indicate "serious differences" in the way certain CTAs are
defining BNAW -- "differences that may have compromised the
ability to compare rates of return among different advisors."
    CFTC said CTAs must only use funds under their control or
in conjunction with their carrying futures commission merchants
in calculating BNAV.
    Computation of BNAV must exclude any item that is not
money, securities or other tangible property and any funds that
are not under the control of the CTA, or CTA in conjunction
with its carrying futures commission merchant.
    CFTC said "notational" funds must be excluded because they
are merely verbal promises to furnish funds.
    Funds in a commodity trading account over which a CTA has
discretionary trading authority must be included, CFTC said.

<DATELINE>    TRAIL, British Columbia, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd said it set
tentative talks with three striking union locals that rejected
on Saturday a three-year contract offer at Cominco's Trail and
Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc operations.
    The locals, part of United Steelworkers of America,
represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. No date has
been set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query.
    The spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two
other striking locals, representing 600 office and technical
workers. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down
since the strike started May 9.
    Each of the five locals has a separate contract that
expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the Sullivan mine at
Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for
processing at Trail.
    Revenues from Trail's smelter totaled 356 mln Canadian dlrs
in 1986.

    Durham told Reuters the company was examining potential
candidates but not yet talking with any. Any acquisition must
have a different economic cycle to copper, he said.
    Phelps Dodge, the largest U.S. copper producer, last year
paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co which makes carbon
black used in rubber and tires. The purchase was part of a
strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between
copper and non-copper operations.
    The company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to
buy another non-copper firm, Durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs
of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.

<TITLE>EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) should
watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
Nicolas Mosar said today.
    Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the
Gulf, Mosar warned, "An escalation in the Gulf would increase
tensions in the oil market."
    "But I do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conference
after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
    He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
year. "There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
world," he added.
    The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
ministers' meeting, he added.
    A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
meeting on June 19, he said.
    But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
foreign ministers, diplomats said.
    West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant
ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
supplies.

    Simultaneously with the filing of the civil case in U.S.
District Court here, the company, formerly Windsor Industries
Inc, three former officers and a former director, agreed to
settle the charges without admitting or denying them.
    But under the settlement, the company and the other
defendants consented to court orders barring them from
committing further violations of securities law.
    There were no monetary penalties in the settlement and the
company, which was delisted from the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system in May
1985, was not required to restate its earnings.
    The SEC charged Jose Arrojo, a vice president of a Windsor
subsidiary, Ronald Kahn, former vice of the company, and David
Garvin, former president of a Windsor subsidiary, with taking
part in a scheme to inflate the value of Windsor's 1982
year-end inventory, resulting in a 2.0 mln dlr overstatement of
the company's pre-tax income for that year.
    The company's inventory was again falsified a year later,
resulting in a 1.6 mln dlr overstatement, the SEC charged.
    Another defendant, Arthur Usheroff, a former Windsor board
member, the company and Kahn also failed to disclose in an SEC
filing an arrangement under which Usheroff was compensated for
services rendered in a 1983 Windsor public stock offering, the
agency said.
    Arrojo, Kahn and the company were also charged with making
false statements in required SEC filings.
    Windsor filed for bankruptcy in August 1985 and had a plan
of reorganization approved last December.

expressing concern that the change of command at the Federal
Reserve may lead to a tougher U.S. Policy on debt and less
understanding of the problems of the Third World.
    Paul Volcker, head of the Federal Reserve, was considered
here to be understanding of Brazil's difficulties.
    A Finance Ministry source said of his colleagues in the
ministry: "They are a bit apprehensive about (Alan) Greenspan
(who will replace Volcker), considering his reputation as a
very tough man, an advocate of recessive measures to
counter-attack inflation. There is a little bit of concern."

Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley
area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting
of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The
south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with
germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas
are generally in the good to very good range.
   Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's current account deficit
narrowed to 76 mln N.Z. Dlrs in April from a revised 89 mln
dlrs in March, and 224 mln dlrs in April 1986, in a smoothed
seasonally-adjusted measurement, the Statistics Department
said.
    The March figure was revised from 69 mln dlrs.
    The department said in a statement seasonally adjusted, but
non-smoothed figures, showed a deficit of 99 mln dlrs against
76 mln dlrs in March and 230 mln dlrs in April 1986.
    Totally unadjusted figures show a deficit of 83 mln dlrs
against 164 mln dlrs in March, revised from 178 mln dlrs, and
compared with 262 mln in April 1986.
    The smoothed seasonally adjusted series shows a surplus on
merchandise trade of 145 mln dlrs against 135 mln dlrs in March
and 30 mln dlrs in April 1986.
    Seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed figures show a
merchandise trade surplus of 132 mln dlrs against a 148 mln dlr
surplus in March and a 14 mln dlr surplus in April 1986.
    Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 151 mln
dlrs against a 5.0 mln dlr (revised from 10 mln dlr) deficit in
March and a 31 mln dlr deficit in March 1986.
    The smoothed seasonally adjusted deficit on invisibles was
234 mln N.Z. Dlrs against 236 mln dlrs in March and 255 in
April 1986.
    The seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed deficit on
invisibles was 240 mln dlrs against 229 mln dlrs in March and
245 mln dlrs in April 1986. The unadjusted deficit on
invisibles was 234 mln dlrs against 158 mln dlrs, revised from
168 mln dlrs, in March and 231 mln dlrs in April 1986.
    Seasonally adjusted export and import figures were not
available.
    The department said these figures show a continuing
improvement in the current account deficit, caused mainly by an
improvement in the balance on merchandise trade which has now
being in surplus since november 1985.

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. meat industry has launched an
aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer
awareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to
relax current beef import quotas.
    U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs
annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high
as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were
removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the
attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export
Federation said at a press conference today.
    Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the
Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)
program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was
launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.
    "The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the
bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports," said Philip Seng,
Asian Director for the Federation. "We supply and they (Japan)
buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to
buy more," he said.
    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits
total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.
imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding
U.S. beef shipments to Japan.
    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy
Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement
expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get
underway this fall.
    The Reagan administration has called for an end to the
quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they
would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.
    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that
they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that
they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.
    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market
has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry
officials said.
    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.
tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs
for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association
said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs
per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.
    Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef
per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,
officials said.
    Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000
tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a
decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln
tonnes.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PASSES MIDEAST GULF BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House today approved a bill
requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on
its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions.
    The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an
alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who
sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of
legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said
he would try to prevent consideration of the bill.
    He said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he
finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting
Kuwaiti tankers.
    Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted
about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some
charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.
    Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military
obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on
American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to
war.
    "It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will
blow sky-high at worst," said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth.

<TITLE>VOLCKER LEAVES VOID ON LDC DEBT, BANKERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY ALAN WHEATLEY, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paul Volcker's resignation as Federal
Reserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a
time of deep uncertainty about the future management of the
third-world debt crisis, bankers said.
    They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold
the financial system together when Mexico halted interest
payments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever
since.
    "Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly
there's a terrible void," one New York banker said.
    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed
because International Monetary Fund managing director Michel
Camdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it
hard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.
    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has little
experience of international affairs and third world debt.
    "Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues
and the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker
has. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.
That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive
feeling," one banker said.
    This banker, who has discussed debt questions with
Greenspan, described his views as simplistic.
    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was not
worried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.
    "People rush to judgment, but once they get to know
Greenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,"
said Hormats, a former Administration official.
    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the
initial comparison, Hormats said. "Volcker had the status of a
financial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,"
he said.
    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together with
the Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the banking
system intact after Mexico's default.
    "If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lot
different now," he said. "Whether you agreed with him or not,
he has a superb grasp of ideas."
    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time with
Volcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some for
more or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico
generous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt
rescheduling agreement.
    "Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the
bounds and pushing the package onto the banks," commented one
banker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.
    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who said
the 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and
thus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.
    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of
others that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines
and Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt
crisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to
bolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.
    "It certainly contributed to the general feeling of
malaise," one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of
the Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion
dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.
    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan and
Security Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of
creditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.
    But no one is sure what the impact will be. "It's very
difficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is
going, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the
uncertainty," one banker said.

<TITLE>NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Currency futures are likely to move
higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
as his replacement, currency analysts said.
    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
analysts said.
    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said.
   
    "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
lower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
Mackoff.
    "The international community will not like this
appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
Horner.
     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months ago
suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"
Horner said.
    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
summit, he said.
    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
be at an impasse, analysts said.
    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
changes," Horner said.
    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK SUSPENDS LOANS TO PERU - CENTRAL BANK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Walker Simon, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     LIMA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank has suspended loans to Peru
because the country has over two months of payment arrears with
the lending agency, central bank general manager Hector Neyra
said.
     He told reporters the government decided to stop paying
the World Bank because scheduled repayments outweighed the
loans it was due to receive.
     The measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adopted
by the government of President Alan Garcia, one of Latin
America's most delinquent debtors. The 22-month-old
administration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earnings
on nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.
     Neyra said since late 1986 Peru had sought an accomodation
with the World Bank under which it would receive more credits
than it would remit in repayments.
     Neyra stressed Peru was not withdrawing from the world
bank. The country had recently increased its capital
suscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.
    The Bank would immediately resume loan disbursements to
Peru once it cleared its arrears, he said. He did not specify
the value of the overdue payments. The economy ministry said
Peru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.
    At the end of last year, Peru's total foreign debt stood at
14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which is
medium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. Total
arrears were 5.42 billion dollars.
    Central bank president Leonel Figueroa said Peru had enough
hard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11
months' worth of imports.
    The holdings of the two precious metals and the hard
currencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on May 22, 1987,
he said.
    Gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrs
because this classification did not include silver holdings and
undervalued the central bank's gold.
    Reserves were projected to fall at most 150 mln dlrs this
year, he said.

    The May consumer price index, which has the same base, rose
1.4 pct to 149.1 after a 0.3 pct gain in April, for a
year-on-year rise of 3.5 pct.
    Wholesale prices rose 2.0 pct in the first five months of
1986, while consumer prices rose by 3.2 pct. Bank officials
said the rises were due to a strong yen which made imports of
Japanese parts, raw and intermediary materials more expensive.

Brazil to renew negotiations with creditors on its 111-billion
dlr foreign debt within the next 30 days, Finance Minister Luiz
Carlos Bresser Pereira said.
    The plan, which predicted the economy would grow 4.5 pct
this year and inflation would drop to 10 pct a month by
December from 20 pct at present, would be officially announced
"within three or four weeks," he told a news conference.
    The minister said he presented an outline of the program
during a cabinet meeting in which President Jose Sarney
declared "a total war" on inflation.
    Sarney told the meeting an austerity plan to trim
government spending would be introduced.
    Bresser Pereira said Brazil faced the risk of economic
recession, but he estimated the gross national product would
grow 4.5 pct this year. It grew 8.3 pct last year.
    Its April inflation rate was a record 20.96 pct and
contributed to an accumulated rate of 84.19 pct in the first
four months of 1987.
    Bresser Pereira said the economic plan would seek to keep
the economy growing, to build an eight billion dlr trade
surplus and to force a sharp drop in the inflation rate.

Rhine, blocked by two sunken boats, will remain closed at least
until the beginning of next week, a water authority spokesman
said today.
    Karlsruhe water authorities said a queue of about 70 ships
had formed between the towns of Speyer and Iffezheim but most
shipping companies had unloaded cargoes and were using
alternative means of transport.
    Heinz-Josef Recker, of the Mannheim water authority, said
two floating cranes would make a fresh attempt to raise the
sunken tug and its lighter after an unsuccessful try on Friday.
The tug Orinoko hit a railway bridge last Tuesday and sank with
a cargo of 3,500 tonnes of gravel on board. Before the
accident, about 100 ships a day sailed under the bridge.

0.6 pct, the lowest since last July when there was no increase,
the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
    In April, inflation was 2.2 pct and the figure for May last
year was 1.6 pct. The rate for the first five months of 1987
was 7.5 pct, the bureau said.
    The annual inflation rate for the past 12 months was 20.3
pct, a bureau spokesman said.
    Israeli inflation was running at an annual rate of more
than 400 pct until the government imposed an austerity plan
controlling wages and prices in mid-1985.

<TITLE>CUBA SUGAR HARVEST ENDS AFTER LONG DELAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAVANA, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Cuban sugar harvest, which was
extended almost a month and a half beyond its originally
scheduled shutdown date, ended here as the last of the island's
154 mills closed operations, the official newspaper granma
said.
    The newspaper characterized the harvest, which began in
late November, 1986, as "a tense and pressured campaign."
    In a recent interview with the French communist party
newspaper l'humanite, Cuban president Fidel Castro said that
crude sugar production during the harvest would be "less than
7.5 mln tonnes.
    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain
which reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonable
rain storms during the first two months of this year which made
cane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.
    Many foreign sugar experts voiced doubts during the present
harvest that raw sugar production would exceed last year's 7.2
mln tonne mark.
    In the 1984-85 campaign Cuba produced 8.2 mln tonnes of raw
sugar.

<TITLE>EC FARM CRISIS LIKELY TO GO TO END-JUNE SUMMIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans for key reforms of the European
Community's (EC) controversial farm policy will almost
certainly have to be referred to the bloc's heads of government
at a summit meeting on June 29 and 30, Belgian finance minister
Mark Eyskens said today.
    Eyskens was speaking at a news conference after chairing a
joint meeting of EC finance and agriculture ministers which was
designed to help break a deadlock over this year's EC farm
price package which has endured since March.
    Diplomats quoted EC Executive Commission president Jacques
Delors as saying at the same meeting that it would be a
disaster if the two most difficult issues at the farm talks had
to be referred to heads of government.
    These issues are a Commission plan for a tax on marine and
vegetable fats and oils, and proposals to change the system by
which EC farm prices, expressed in European currency units
(Ecus), are translated into the currencies of member states.
    The oils and fats tax is opposed by a group of countries
which fears it could provoke trade retaliation by the U.S., A
major exporter of soybeans to the EC.
    West Germany, meanwhile, is strongly against the technical
currency move, which would result in additional price cuts for
farmers in countries with strong currencies, such as the mark.
    Commission sources said Delors is anxious that the two
issues are not referred to the summit because this would mean
heads of government diverting their attention from much more
important world and Community issues.
    Eyskens said decisions from heads of government were also
likely to be less sound since they do not usually interest
themselves in such technically complex questions.
    However, Eyskens said today's meeting had thrown up some
nuances in member state positions "which may make the dialogue
more constructive in the next few weeks."
    If farm prices are not decided by the end of this month,
the Commission could use its own powers to impose a seven pct
cut in cereals prices, farm trade sources said. It originally
proposed measures to cut farm spending by 1.1 billion Ecus this
year, with effective price cuts of over 10 pct for some crops.
    Diplomats said farm ministers might be able to agree a
price package cutting spending by around 340 mln Ecus but for
their disagreements on the oils/fats tax and on currency
reforms.
    The finance ministers were called in to emphasise the need
for budgetary restraint in the face of an almost certain EC
budget deficit of over five billion Ecus this year.
    Although Delors was said by aides to have found today's
meeting very useful, diplomats said there was little sign of a
major shift in the position of member states, or of finance
ministers adopting a different line from that of their
agriculture colleagues.
    The farm ministers are expected to meet for most of this
week in Luxembourg in a pre-summit attempt to bridge their
differences.

<TITLE>WORLD FAILS AFRICA ON RECOVERY, CONFERENCE TOLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABUJA, Nigeria, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Africa's efforts to revive its
economy are not being matched by international help, two of the
continent's heads of state said at the opening of a conference.
    Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou-
Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to act
over the continent's debt, which now totals 175 billion dlrs,
at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA).
    Their view was backed by Monique Landry, Canada's Minister
for External Relations. "Whether we look at aid or debt or
trade, the rich countries have not as yet lived up to their
part of last year's economic recovery pact."
    Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country to
spend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicing
particularly as prices for the continent's commodities were so
unstable.
    Sassou Nguesso, current Chairman of the Organisation of
African Unity, accused international aid donors of failing to
provide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago.
    The conference, attended by African ministers, economists
and representatives from major donors, will review progress
since both sides agreed at the U.N. Last year to revive the
African economy over five years.
    The response from the international community has been
negative and projections of improved growth rates for Africa
already look far too optimistic, ECA Executive Secretary
Adebayo Adedeji told the conference.
    Both Babangida and Sassou Nguesso called for the debts of
Africa's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment
and grace terms to be eased.
    They won a degree of support from Landry, "Even private
bankers are willing to talk about the need for longer term
solutions to Africa's debt."

famine in certain areas near its border with Togo following
scant rainfall, Accra Radio reported today.
    The Radio, monitored in Abidjan, said fishing and farming
activities have been disrupted in certain districts around the
Volta region near the eastern coast.
    The report follows a period of unusually dry weather in
both Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which trade sources in Abidjan
said could pose problems for important developing cocoa crops.
    The Accra Radio report said a Ghanaian government
delegation, which visited the Anglo and Ketu districts last
week to investigate reports of food shortages, promised the
people a regular supply of maize, rice and sugar.
    At Anglo, the delegation was told that the Keta Lagoon had
dried up, halting fishing activities, while catches at sea were
poor and crops had failed, all due to lack of rainfall.

<TITLE>CONCENTRATION OF ZINC INDUSTRY SEEN CONTINUING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world's zinc mining and smelting
industry will continue to become more concentrated and more
integrated in the 1990s, Dr Klaus Goekmann, vice-president of
marketing and sales for Cominco Ltd, said.
    Opening a Metal Bulletin base metals conference here,
Goekmann forecast the number of individual businesses in the
industry would continue to decline as companies merged or
formed conglomerates with increased market shares.
    At the same time, the conglomerates would become more
integrated, handling the entire chain from basic ore production
through marketing, he added.
    "The key to future viability will be flexibility. Prices are
likely to remain at current historically low levels at least in
the medium term, and competition with other metals and
materials will continue to intensify," Goekmann said.
    "In the past, we have only reacted to changes in the world's
market and economics. In the future, we have to act less
defensively and more aggressively."
    The industry also has massive overcapacity and this problem
has to be tackled quickly, he added.
    "Attempts in the past to cut out this excess capacity in
Europe have all failed miserably. However, there is some hope
that current efforts may be successful," Goekmann said.
    At the same time, companies must move to limit their
geographical and currency risks and become far more marketing
orientated, he added.
    "With all these changes and rationalization, the industry
can survive to recover its past strength and profitability.
Without them, the future does not look very rosy," Goekmann
said.

<TITLE>BASIN PIPELINE REOPENS IN U.S. SOUTHWEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Basin Pipeline in the Southwestern
U.S. reopened yesterday with the expectation that all crude oil
shipments for June will arrive on schedule, according to a
spokesman for Texaco Inc. &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline
through its Texaco Pipeline Co subsidiary.
    "We project the pipeline will make all June crude shipments
scheduled," said Dan Stevens, the spokesman. 
    The pipeline reopened Sunday evening around 1900 EDT,
carrying an equivalent 280,000 barrels of crude oil per day
compared with an average 225,000 bpd shipped during the 30 days
before its shutdown on May 30, according to Stevens.
    Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for all
crude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via the
pipeline by the end of June.
    The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupture
caused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahoma
border. It was expected to resume service Saturday but rising
waters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed the
reopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inch
steel piping was installed under the river to replace damaged
piping, according to Stevens.

<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain has joined the group of
European Community countries opposed to the proposed tax on
marine and vegetable oils and fats, diplomatic sources said.
    They said the Spanish position was clarified at a joint
meeting here of EC finance and agriculture ministers to discuss
the budgetary situation surrounding this year's EC farm price
negotiations.
    Previously, West Germany, Britain, Portugal and Denmark
have declared themselves against the tax with Spain's position
unclear, the sources said.
    The sources said Spanish junior finance minister Guillermo
de la Dehesa said Spain was against the tax because of its
implications for world trade talks within the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade and because it was discrimatory by
excluding butter.
    They said the countries now opposed to the tax have far
more votes than needed under the EC's majority voting system to
block the proposal.

<TITLE>CAOBISCO CONDEMNS EC OILS AND FATS TAX PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The proposed European Community (EC) levy
on oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO, the
association of EC biscuit, chocolate and confectionery
manufacturers.
    In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers,
M. Eyskens, the association said the tax would cost the EC
biscuit, cake, chocolate and confectionery industries almost
200 mln European currency units per year.
    The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S.
Retaliatory measures on EC exports, CAOBISCO said.
    In a parallel move the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and
Confectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy.
    President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending the
Commission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumer
taxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries.

<TITLE>POOR RAINFALL MAY HIT IVORY COAST COCOA - TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lack of rainfall in recent weeks may
have affected Ivory Coast 1987/88 main crop cocoa prospects,
although good precipitation in the last half of June and in
July could still reverse the situation, trade sources said.
    They said the crop is still likely to be fairly large and
it is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spell
on the harvest.
    "This year's crop will probably be another good one. It is
impossible to tell how flowering is going, but there should be
no problems unless something drastic happens," one trader said.
    Private forecaster Accu-Weather reported today that most
Ivory Coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the
weekend and similar weather will persist today and Tuesday.
    "Rain would be welcomed, as the past week has been quite
dry, except along the western portion of the coast," it said.
    Traders agreed rain was needed, but some noted that the dry
conditions had not affected the entire country.
    The Ivorian Meteorological Office could not be reached for
comment or recent statistics. The trade sources said rainfall
in recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants,
although it is difficult to assess what the minimum
requirements are.
    Trade sources said there had been good rains in late
January, February and March which helped to promote flowering,
but April and May were fairly dry in most areas except in the
south west of the country.
    The Ivory Coast mid-crop should have been covered by
March/April rains but the main crop, still in its formation
period, depends largely on rainfall from April through July.
    The main rains normally last between May and July, before
returning again in September/October. "Flowering has been less
than normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the
moment, then they have a chance to recover," one trader said.
    Another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of
time to develop and the rains were "not good but still not bad."
    The sources said that while the weather might emerge as a
cause for concern, crop conditions in West Africa were
presently taking a back seat to other factors in the
international cocoa market.
    This is not only because of the premature nature of any
harvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa
already burdening the market, they said.
    "With a third year of surplus overhanging the market and the
buffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases,
the weather has not been a factor," one private consultant said.
    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus said in its April cocoa
market report the current 1986/87 Ivory Coast crop was likely
to total 570,000 tonnes, which compares with a record 1985/86
crop estimate of 585,000 tonnes.

<TITLE>EC OFFICIAL WARNS U.S. ON UNILATERAL TRADE MOVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roy Denman, the European Community
representative in Washington, warned the United States against
setting a rule that trading partners running a surplus should
be "beaten over the head" for not removing trade barriers.
    Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, said
trade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,
either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-based
United Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
GATT.
    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debate
this week on a major trade bill.
    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners
running a surplus with the United States should be beaten over
the head if trade barriers objected to by the United States are
not removed within a certain time-scale," said Denman in an
apparent reference to some of the measures in the congressional
trade bill.
    "If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliation
and counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading system
will very quickly unravel," he said.
    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was not
purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.
    "The trade deficit results from a combination of
macroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchange
rate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"
Denman said.
    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfair
trade prctices.
    He said the European Community had recently updated a list
of some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.
    "We did not circulate this list with any hostile or
aggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight," Denman
said.

<TITLE>GERMANY PLANS TO RUSH SPECIAL CREDITS TO FARMERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Felix Dearden, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bonn is expected to rush through
legislation this month creating special credits to protect West
German farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, payments
freeze, government sources said.
    The new measures are apparently designed to shield West
German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget
crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC
executive commission's farm policy reform plans, political
sources said.
    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint
session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over
future farm financing.
    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission
attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing
imports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.
retaliation.
    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary
mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.
    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-right
coalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would provide
temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.
    The Commission, facing a five billion European Currency
Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the
year, has threatened to start phasing out payment of some
subsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member states
take urgent measures to provide fresh funds.
    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new
legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to
a farm price package for 1986/87.
    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the
sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies
by creating a buffer for West German farmers.
    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and
allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead of
the summer recess, SPD sources said.
    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party
would support the bill, even though it would further swell
massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill
was an admission that the government believes the farm price
talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.
    According to a copy of the draft bill obtained by Reuters,
government authorities will have over two billion marks (1.1
billion dlrs) available to pay farmers advance subsidies and
premiums for grains and other crops harvested this summer.
    The Commission has agreed to pay the subsidies eventually.
But paying farmers on time will cost Bonn about 100 mln marks
(55 mln dlrs) in interest payments, farm policy sources said.
    Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet is expected to support the
bill when it meets tomorrow.

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS DOLLAR DROP WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James
Baker said any further decline in the dollar against other
currencies would be counterproductive.
    Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic
Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President
Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could
see some further decline in the dollar within reason.
    "All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in
the dollar would be counterproductive," Baker told reporters.
    Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White
House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that
the United States wants a stable dollar.
    The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker
dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit,
but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and
appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar
against the yen and the mark during the past two years.

<TITLE>HEDGERS INCREASE SHARE OF U.S. CRUDE OIL FUTURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commercial hedgers increased their
stake in sales of U.S. crude oil and heating oil futures during
May, according to a U.S. federal agency report.
    Trade hedgers accounted for 64.7 pct of open short
positions in May, compared with 58.2 pct in April, and added
5,700 new sales in May, while liquidating almost 11,000
purchases, the report said.
    Speculators, in contrast, saw a decline in share of crude
oil shorts in May. May spec shorts totaled 13.6 pct versus 25.6
pct in April. The report was prepared by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.                                   
     In heating oil futures, commercial users accounted for
68.7 pct of short postions in May versus 58.2 pct in April and
added 311 new short positions.
    Gasoline futures saw little change in the percentage of
short or long positions held by commercial users, speculators,
or small traders, according to the CFTC report. Trade users 
accounted for 72.5 pct of short gasoline futures positions in
May, compared with a revised 75.7 pct in April.

<TITLE>GERMAN STEEL INDUSTRY TO SEEK LAY-OFF FUNDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Felix Dearden, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German Government will be asked
June 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 million
dollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobs
are threatened by the recent slump in the country's steel
industry.
    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut
Kohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and trade
unions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow.
    Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tell
Kohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough to
protect German steel firms from subsidies and unfair
competition from other European Community members.
    Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in a
common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But
since the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts by
slashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up the
whole bill for the layoffs, the sources said.
    A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union,
said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workers
in Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would be
redeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,
while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retraining
schemes.
    The union estimates that the redundancy payments would
total 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while job
retraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130
million dollars).
    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the next
few years following steep losses incurred by the industry since
mid-1986.
    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years was
unable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar which
depressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO YIELD DAMAGE YET IN U.S. CORN, BEANS - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. corn and soybean crops are
in mostly good condition and have not suffered any yield
deterioration from recent hot, dry weather, Agriculture
Department and private weather and crop analysts said.
    "I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet," Norton
Strommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. "The (corn
and soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and is
progressing ahead of normal, which is good," he said.
    Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areas
sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing new
crop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrs
per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs.
    "This rally is amazing," a private crop analyst said. "Corn,
soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."
    The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm,
dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up
development of the crop, which will help the crop better cope
with stress later in its more critical growing period.
    "What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards
rapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on the
subsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go through
a little stress early on," Strommen said.
    Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in
most growing areas.
    Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and
soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July
and August.
    But because of its early development this year, Strommen
said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction
period by the first of July.
    "Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or
soybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the
dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks," an
analyst said.
    Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more
weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop
analysts agreed.
    August and September are the critical yield-producing
months for soybeans, Strommen said.
    "The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive
during May, June and July until the August rains which
determine the crop," a crop analyst said.
    Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing
areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure
that there will not be problems later.
    Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather
forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal
precipitation in much of the corn belt.
    "This opens up all sorts of speculation," he said.

<TITLE>HOT WEATHER PUSHES CBT GRAINS TO NEW HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with
more forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the
30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for
delivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set
life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a
bushel.
    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than
normal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistant
vice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone as
high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to
measure the euphoria level."
    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,
posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit
in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.
    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,
with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4
dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved
harvest conditions in the southern Midwest.
    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean
plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit
young plants by encouraging the development of deep root
systems, Bartholomew said.
    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to
active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean
orders went unfilled at the close, traders said.
    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not
suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.
    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the
dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more
expensive for foreign buyers.
    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's
COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle
steady.
    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the
weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of
inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,
which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.
trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.
    A USDA report released after trading said the number of
cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above
levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would
probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52
mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade
forecasts.
    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,
up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off
93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.
    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot
weather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Noranda Inc said contract talks that
resumed today were continuing with about 1,600 unionized
workers at its 63 pct-owned Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp
&lt;BMS.TO> lead-zinc mine and lead smelter at Bathurst, New
Brunswick.
    A Noranda official said in reply to an inquiry that the

are part of the United Steelworkers of America.
    The mineworkers' contract expires July 1. They will vote on
June 22 either to authorize a strike or ratify a possible
contract offer. The smelter workers' pact expires July 21.
    The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and
206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct
zinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000
tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead.

<DATELINE>    Trail, British Columbia, June 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd has no
contract negotiations scheduled this week with any of the five
striking locals at the Trail smelter and Kimberley lead-zinc
mine, union spokesmen said.
    However, leaders of the negotiating teams are trying to set
up an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, said John
Owens, spokesman for United Steelworkers of America local 480,
which is one of three locals that represents 2,600 production
and maintenance workers.
    Owens also said Cominco has said the strike is costing it
five mln Canadian dlrs a day in debt service costs that are not
covered by revenue. He said the company has not estimated total
lost revenue and Cominco spokesmen were not immediately
available for comment.
    The strike, which began May nine, also involves two locals
that represent 600 office and technical workers.
    The production and maintenance workers three weeks ago
rejected a tentative three-year agreement that provided cost of
living adjustments but no basic wage increase.
    Each of the five locals has a separate contract that
expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at
Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for
processing at the Trail smelter.

<TITLE>THREE U.S. EXCHANGES VIE FOR GOLD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patricia Campbell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The glitter of gold has generated a
three-way competition among the world's largest futures
exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.
    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces
gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go
toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange
Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe
as the world's precious metals futures capital for
institutional business.
    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending
application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side
with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)
gold futures.
    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in
1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument
in July 1986.
    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the
exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent
volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the
decision may also have been clearing problems in May which
forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in
an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,
especially in silver futures.
    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for
other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals
contracts, industry sources say.
    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges
can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume
of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to
buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.
    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold
contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,
was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has
surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.
    "The climate could not be better for this venture by the
CME," said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil
McGarrity.
    "Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting
daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.
There's good trading volume in all world outlets," McGarrity
added.
    "The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,
merchants and customers that there would be a market open for
trading," if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the
Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice
president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.
Inc. and a Comex board member.
    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold
futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York
warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery
through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member
of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies
delivery from New York and Chicago vaults.
    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an
earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting
time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start
allows for trading before many important government reports are
released at 7:30 a.m. CDT.
    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist
with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be
generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term
debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge
their financial risks.
    "If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy
gold," said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.
    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold
trading. "Given our night trading session, we could add either
our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver
contract to attract overseas business," a CBT official said.
    Which market is identified as the precious metal capital
does not appear to be a major issue among professionals.
    "We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with
perhaps different needs," Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry
Jarecki said.
    "Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid
contract. Our firm is no exception," Jarecki said.
    "At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will
be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing
processes," a CME official added.

up an informal meeting to discuss the stalemate, John Owens,
spokesman for United Steelworkers of America local 480 said.
    Owens said Cominco has said the strike, which began May 9,

costs that are not covered by revenue. He said the company has
not estimated total lost revenue.
    Cominco spokesmen were not immediately available for

enable it to respond more quickly to the high demand for
Commodity Credit Corp.-owned soybeans.
    The CCC has suspended its practice of contacting storing
warehousemen before selling soybeans for cash to a third party,
said Collyn Peterson, deputy director in the ASCS Kansas City
office.
    In addition, he said, minimum quantities for sales will be
25,000 bushels, or all of a warehouse total inventory if less

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan today sent a
classified report to Congress on his plan to protect Kuwaiti
oil tankers with U.S. military escorts.
    Congressional officials said the report, received by House
Speaker Jim Wright and Senate majority leader Robert Byrd, will
not be made public.
    Congress has demanded a detailed security plan on how U.S.
warships and servicemen would be protected from possible attack
in the Gulf region, scene of the prolonged war between Iran and
Iraq.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Administration intended to push ahead with the plan despite
strong opposition in Congress.
    He said the report to Congress provided a comprehensive
overview of Administration strategy in the Gulf, adding the
military escort plan would begin "when the President was
satisfied that all preparations had been completed
satisfactorily".
    Fitzwater did not say when this might be, but denied the
protection plan was being held up.

<TITLE>EC CONSIDERS NEW PROPOSALS TO END FARM DEADLOCK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) executive
Commission will today urgently consider whether to take a new
initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the
bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.
    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what
diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint
meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in
Luxembourg Monday.
    Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present
farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for
1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were
first announced in March.
    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a
plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance
rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures
which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted
into member state currencies.
    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans
fiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax
plan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a
chance of agreement on other aspects of the package.
      These include measures to cut the effective price paid to
farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.
      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would
include plans for revising the current oils and fats and
currency regulations.
     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in
meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues
could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at
the end of the month.
    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure
the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means
of financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be
"disastrous" if farm issues had to be discussed by government
leaders.
    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75
billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,
the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the
traditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said
    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired
yesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards some
aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to
be referred to the summit.
    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as
useful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed
to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.
    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have
lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and
fats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal.

<TITLE>STUDY SAYS U.S. EMPLOYMENT NOT JEOPARDIZED BY BORDER PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MCALLEN, Texas, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The growing shift of low-skilled
manufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican border
cities is not a threat to American employment because it will
help create new markets for products, according to a study
released today.
    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute of
Arizona, which studies international trade issues, said the
United States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturing
in developing countries so that those nations can become
consumers of more U.S. goods.
    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,
Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission
which is gathering information for a report to Congress on what
changes may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the
loss of jobs and industry.
    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from
a trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ
factory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.
    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient
tax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into
Mexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that
are completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.
    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in
low-paying jobs across the border reflected changing
demographics of the U.S. workforce.
    "In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available
to fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be
better educated than prior generations," Bolin told reporters in
McAllen.
    "The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported to
other countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not be
able to fill in the future."
    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plunged
by more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to the
transfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. American
employment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 during
the same period, he said.
    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make up
more than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages and
generate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS DOLLAR SHOULD BE ABOVE 170 YEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar should worth more than 170 yen
based on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on
international trade.
    Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation
differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth
quarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.
    MITI also said the so-called "J-curve" and the drop in oil
prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6
billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.
    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose
to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.
    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5
billion dlrs and the "J-curve" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in
the 1986 surplus.
    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in
recent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be
accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in
economic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36
pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.
    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982
to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange
rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of
imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic
growth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other
minor factors have been left out.
    "One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of
exports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to
experience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally
predisposed to growth in exports," MITI said.
    Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under
the impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are
stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.
    Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry
cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor
in the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe,
replacing design and brand reputations.
    "The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for
measures to address the needs of affected firms," it said. "Whole
industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to
suffer."
    "Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will
also be an essential condition," the ministry said.
    It said four structural factors have contributed to the
growth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline
in U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive
capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies
and short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.
    "While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with the
dollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in
the import picture," MITI said.

<TITLE>KEATING REVISES 1986/87 AUSTRALIA PAYMENTS DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasurer Paul Keating said he now
expected the Australian current account deficit for fiscal
1986/87 ending June 30 to come in around 13.25 billion dlrs.
    In a statement released after Statistics Bureau figures
showed the May deficit was below forecasts at 866 mln dlrs,
Keating said the cumulative deficit is now likely to be about
1.5 billion dlrs below the Treasury forecast of 14.75 billion
issued with the 1986/87 Budget papers last August.
    However, the government had subsequently revised the
forecast to around 13.75 billion dlrs after a series of current
account figures indicated a declining trend.
    Keating's revised 1986/87 current account deficit forecast
compares with a record shortfall of 14.40 billion dlrs in
1985/86, a level nearly double the 7.29 billion deficit
recorded only two years earlier in 1983/84.
    Keating said the main reason for his revision was a
better-than-expected export performance. Recent quarterly
figures showed export volumes rose 14.4 pct in the half-year to
March 30 while import volumes rose only 0.9 pct, he said.
    The Bureau data issued today showed the cumulative deficit
for the first 11 months of 1986/87 narrowed to 12.32 billion
dlrs from 13.21 billion a year earlier.

<TITLE>TAIWAN, URUGUAY IN PRICE DISPUTE OVER SOYBEANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Uruguayan suppliers have agreed to supply
Taiwan with only 25,000 tonnes of soybeans out of a total
70,000 tonnes agreed in April, a spokesman for the joint
committee of Taiwan's soybean importers told Reuters.
    He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayans
reluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56
U.S. Dlrs per tonne.
    The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment after
the Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order,
but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June
5-25, the committee spokesman said.
    Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayan
grain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices on
the soybeans but said the government would not intervene in the
dispute.
    "The deal was agreed to between two private companies,
without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayan
government," Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman Andres
Bonino said.
    He added, "Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes of
soybeans, since total production this year has been lower than
that figure."
    The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the
70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10.
    Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, told
reporters, "Both countries are finishing details to arrive at a
satisfactory price."
    He said the price would be "very advantageous (for Uruguay)
because it will be above the international price."
    Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year,
making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed.
    Taiwan's joint committee holds a tender today for two
shipments of U.S. Soybeans totalling 87,000 tonnes.

<TITLE>SUMMIT DEEPENS IMF COORDINATION ROLE,OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Venice summit accord gives the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility in
smoothing vital economic cooperation between industrial
countries, a senior IMF official said.
    The official, who met reporters but asked not to be
identified, made clear that the use of a series of economic
measurements to monitor the seven leading industrial
democracies would be difficult but was a major step in
cooperation.
    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of
economic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an
attempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.
    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as a
step forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticised
because it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic
behaviour that hurt other countries.
    But the official said influences and peer pressure could
have a major impact in reforming an erring country.
    Economists generally believe a cooperative economic
approach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact
on the global economy, including helping the poorest debtor
countries.
    The official said the IMF function would be to warn
countries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and
try to persuade them to modify it. "I hope it will be a yellow
light, not a red flag," he said.
    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the next
few weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,
which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.
    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currently
financed at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripled
under the plan.
    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very
difficult, with countries pressing each other to do more and
finding reasons to reduce their own exposure. "They will be
tremendously difficult negotiations," he said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN RAISES SUGAR OUTPUT TARGET FOR 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's target for sugar production in
the 1987/88 season (November/May) has been set at 600,000
tonnes, up from the 479,200 tonnes harvested in 1986/87, a
spokesman for the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp told Reuters.
    He said the increase was to meet rising local consumption,
estimated at about 500,000 tonnes in calendar 1988 against
470,000 tonnes in 1987. Taiwan would have a surplus for export
of about 100,000 tonnes in 1988, he said.
    In 1987 Taiwan would have no exportable sugar for the first
time in 40 years because of typhoon damage to more than 6,000
hectares of canefield in 1986, he said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese crushers have so far bought
50,000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment in late
July/August and total purchases for the period are likely to be
around 130,000 tonnes, trade sources said.
    Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June and
July to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenance
work at oil mills.
    But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightly
above monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for a
while due to a better crushing margin compared with that of
soybeans, they said.

pct to 61.07 mln tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 1986 from
56.0 mln in 1985, energy ministry officials told Reuters.
    They said oil accounted for 46.7 pct of energy consumption

    The amount spent on energy imports in 1986 was 4.53 billion
dlrs against 6.54 billion dlrs in 1985, they said, with much of
the difference between the two years due to changes in the
price of oil.

<TITLE>JAPAN GNP RISES 1.2 PCT IN JANUARY/MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's gross national product (gnp) rose
a real 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardly
revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
    The October/December rise was originally put at 0.8 pct.
    For the fiscal year ended last March 31, gnp rose 2.6 pct,
after a 4.3 pct increase in 1985/86. Last year's performance
was the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct,
and was below the government's revised three pct forecast.
    Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for the
slowdown in economic growth in 1986/87.
    Domestic demand increased 0.7 pct in the January/March
quarter and 4.3 pct in the fiscal year, compared with growth of
0.6 pct in October/December and 3.7 pct in 1985/86.
    The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarter
accelerated to 4.9 pct, from 2.9 pct in October/December.
    In nominal terms, gnp rose 0.7 pct in January/March, after
a 0.5 pct October/December rise, reflecting lower prices.
    Domestic demand contributed 0.7 percentage point to real
gnp growth in January/March, while foreign trade added 0.5
point. In October/December domestic demand contributed 0.6
point, while foreign trade added 0.2 point.
    Of the 0.5 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp last
quarter, rising exports accounted for 0.3 point and falling
imports contributed 0.2.
    Total export volume rose 2.0 pct quarter-on-quarter in
January/March, while imports fell 1.2 pct.
    Of the 0.7 point contribution of domestic demand to
January/March gnp growth, the private sector accounted for 1.1
point while the public sector knocked off 0.4.
    The private sector contribution included 0.4 point for
corporate capital outlays and 1.0 for consumer spending, while
destocking subtracted 0.3 point.
    In 1986/87, domestic demand contributed 4.1 percentage
points to growth while foreign trade knocked off 1.5 points.
    In 1985/86, the domestic demand contribution was 3.6 points
and foreign trade 0.7 point.

bales (500 lbs/bale) of U.S. Cotton worth about 110 mln U.S.
Dlrs when it visits several U.S. States early next month, a

    He said a similar mission last year bought 700,000 bales

    He said the mission was buying less U.S. Cotton because the
price is some 15 pct higher than that of cotton from Pakistan
and India. The current average price of U.S. Cotton is 75
cents/lb, but the spokesman estimated the average price will be
53 cents when the shipments are made next year.

International Plc said it had conditionally agreed to buy the
New York-based Carter Organisation Inc for up to 114.6 mln

<TITLE>SHULTZ SEES GOLDEN FUTURE FOR PHILIPPINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
forecast a golden future for the Philippines after talks on its
struggle for economic recovery and its fight against communist
insurgents.
    Speaking at a luncheon after an hour-long meeting with
President Corazon Aquino, Shultz delivered a powerful and
uncompromising endorsement of the Manila government.
    "There is a golden future out there for the Filipino people
to gain," he said. But he tempered his praise with a veiled hint
Washington's attitude might change if what it called the
current realism was seen to be diluted.
    "The political dreams of only 18 months ago are becoming the
democratic institutions of today," Shultz said. "Your economy is
developing an impressive head of steam, the insurgents are
learning that threats and intimidation will not stop the
Filipino people from voting for democracry."
    He said he had been struck by the widespread awareness of
the problems facing the Philippines.
    "No one I have met under-estimates the tasks which lie ahead
or the need to act upon them. That Filipino realism is an
essential element of American confidence in the Philippines," he
said.
    Shultz said the revolution which brought Aquino to power 18
months ago was still under way.
    He praised the efforts made by the armed forces in
combatting the communist insurgency, now in its 18th year,
adding that Aquino was also addressing the social and economic
problems fuelling the rebellion.
    Defence Minister Rafael Ileto, briefing reporters after a
separate meeting with Shultz, said the U.S. Was just as
confident as he was that the communists would be beaten.
    U.S. Officials made it clear before the start of today's
talks that they expected no dramatic developments.

<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Foreign Ministers of the Association
of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) said they expect closer
economic ties with Japan.
    A communique issued at the end of a two-day ministerial
meeting said Asean hoped for greater Japanese investment in the
region, better access for Asean products in the Japanese market
and larger numbers of visiting Japanese tourists.
    The ministers are due to start four days of talks tomorrow
with officials of the U.S., Japan, the European Community, New
Zealand, Australia and Canada, including Secretary of State
George Shultz and Japan's Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari.
    The Asean communique noted Japan's large trade surplus,
which it said would enable Tokyo to play a greater role in the
economic development of ASEAN and in facilitating closer ASEAN
economic cooperation.
    "Japan could also help to facilitate the flow of Japanese
investments to ASEAN through the provision of attractive
financial assistance and incentives for its private sector," it
said.
    The communique also welcomed President Reagan's firm action
in vetoing trade protectionist measures in the Congress.
     The communique said the ASEAN ministers were concerned
over the proliferation of protectionist policies, pressures and
measures in developed countries, the continued depressed level
of commodity prices, the instability of exchange rates and the
lack of a comprehensive solution to the world debt situation.

Chairman Denis Sassou-Nguesso said Africa was unable to pay its
debts due to falling export prices.
    "Even if African countries want to pay their debts they will
not be able to," Congolese president Sassou-Nguesso told a news
conference at a meeting between foreign and African experts on
the continent's economic prospects.
    "You cannot be expected to do the impossible. All our
commodity exports, without exception and even oil, have fallen
in value on international markets," he added.
    "In these conditions can African countries continue to
respect their debt servicing?" Sassou-Nguesso asked.
    He said the debt issue would be the main subject at next
month's OAU summit in Addis Ababa and would not rule out the
possibility of a joint "debtors' revolt" there.
    "Let us wait and see," he replied when asked about the
possibility.
    Debts of sub-Saharan African countries total less than 100
billion dlrs, according to the Economic Commission for Africa
which is organising the current meeting in Nigeria's future
capital.

<TITLE>OPEC OFFICIAL SAYS CARTEL HAS REGAINED LEADERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC has regained its former role as
price-setter in the oil market following last year's price war,
acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said.
    But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand for
OPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continued
sacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries.
    Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, said
the December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr per
barrel reference price gave the market a signal that the
producers' group was serious.
    "It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and this
has restored its credibility," said al-Chalabi, who is in
Caracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors.
    Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded the
production quotas which took effect on February 1 and spot
market prices are now near or above official OPEC prices.
    Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basic
dilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said.
"The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price and
risk losing its market share? Or defend its market share and
let the price drop?" he asked.
    "OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question is
how long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?" 
he said.
    Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up
prices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw no
quick end to restraint in production.
    He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil
because increased non-OPEC production, combined with
conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, has
caused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

<TITLE>ITALIAN ELECTION RESULTS BOOST SHARE PRICES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Daniel Liefgreen, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Milan, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Share prices opened sharply higher,
boosted by Italian general election results which dealt a big
blow to the Communist party and bolstered the Christian
Democrats and Socialists.
    The Milan Stock Index was indicated 2.90 pct higher at 0930
GMT as all sectors were stronger. Among stocks posting early
gains at mid morning was Fiat ordinary, which was indicated
13,090 lire against yesterday's closing of 12,705. These are
provisional, not closing prices.
    Analysts said the results from Sunday's and Monday's voting
should boost the bourse in the short-term, but the market's
medium-term prospects remain clouded because of doubt over how
long it will take to form a new government.
    "The result is positive in the sense that the Communists
suffered a defeat and Italians voted for stability," director
Paolo Azzoni at Milan investment bank &lt;ABK Spa>, told Reuters.
    Uncertainty about the election outcome and the possibility
of large Communist gains has been weighing on the bourse in the
last two weeks, brokers said.
    Final returns show the Socialists, led by former Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi, increasing their vote to 14.3 pct from
11.4 in 1983, while the Communists dropped more than three
points to 26.6 pct.
    Support for the Christian Democrats rose to 34.3 pct from
an all-time low of 32.9 in 1983.
    Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Ing C. Olivetti EC Spa
&lt;OLIV.MI>, commenting on the results last night on Italian
television, said "I am sure the reaction of international
markets will be extremely favourable to the electoral verdict."
    Broker Francesco Dinepi at Milan investment firm &lt;Sige
Spa>, said some U.K. Institutional investors had placed buy
orders in Milan this morning.
    "In the medium-term, the direction of the market depends on
the Christian Democrats and Socialists resolving their
differences," said Dinepi.
     "What Italy wants is another government and quickly," added
Azzoni.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK MAY LIFT VETO ON ECU USE - SOURCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank could announce today
that it will lift its veto on the private holding of European
Currency Unit (ECU) liabilities, banking sources said.
    But this would probably be the only significant news from
today's council session, brought forward from its usual
Thursday date because of the Corpus Christi holiday here. The
Bundesbank is not expected to change credit policy.
    The sources said Bundesbank officials had been working out
technical and legal problems with the ECU since the subject was
discussed in the presence of federal finance minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on May 7.
    With the primary internal work on the ECU completed,
approval from the 18-member central bank council was now
virtually a mere formality, the sources said.
    Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, chairing today's
meeting, said in mid-May the remaining ECU restrictions were
likely to be lifted, allowing individuals to open ECU accounts
and incur liabilities previously mainly executed through the
Luxembourg subsidiaries of the major German banks.
    The sources said the ECU liberalisation was mainly designed
to show that West Germany was prepared to play its part in the
effort to attain European Community monetary unity by 1992.

<TITLE>JAPAN OFFICIALS SAY WORST MAY BE OVER FOR ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Government officials said the worst may be
over for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger
than expected growth in the January/March period.
    But private economists were not so sure and said the
economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth
forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.
    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March
quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three
months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP
growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.
    The government economists acknowledged that the improved
export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to
be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two
pct from the previous three months.
    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150
probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June
quarter, they said.
    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up
domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the
economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.
    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy
will achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the
1987/88 year.
    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's
forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last
December from an original four pct.
    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for
housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi
Research Institute.
    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in
nominal income stays low, he added.
     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter
was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the
preceding three months, Takahashi said.
    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but
this was primarily because utility companies brought forward
their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter
of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation
package announced last fall, he said.
    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he
was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he
expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.
    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting
to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.
    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower
interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the
sector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000
billion yen economic package will also help the economy.
    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the
government's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth
might come close to three pct.

<TITLE>GERMAN STEEL INDUSTRY SEEKS LAY-OFF FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German government today considered
demands for nearly 850 mln marks to lay off or retrain 20,000
steel workers.
    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut
Kohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and trade
unions at a special meeting with steel industry
representatives.
    Companies like Fried Krupp &lt;KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG
&lt;HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken the
unusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IG
Metall, to press for government finance to slim staff levels
still further.
    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part in
a common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But
since the government was struggling to finance tax cuts by
reducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.
    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresaw
redundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhineland
plants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steel
making sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 would
be eligible for job-retraining schemes. Redundancies are
estimated at 600 mln marks, while job retraining would cost a
further 240 mln.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ZINC CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTFALL SEEN IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Next year is likely to see a shortfall
in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there
should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd
metals analyst Stephen Briggs said.
    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals
conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted
100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was
the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling
at Pine Point in Canada.
    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.
    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was
unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in
1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of
record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated
in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity
in South Korea.
    "Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also
expected in 1987," Briggs said.
    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels
at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with
achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro
in Canada.
    Looking further forward, the major event was the probable
opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity
of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.
    "Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there
will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s," he
added.
    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of
zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore
supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from
zinc mines.
    "On this basis, our calculations point to a modest
oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987," Briggs said.
    The copper forecast, however, was for a record
non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,
increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.
    Production of primary refined copper metal would also
increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to
a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes
this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the
decade, he said.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia will try to increase sugar
output in calendar 1988 to 2.4 mln tonnes from an expected 2.2
mln in 1987, Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said.
    He told reporters after meeting President Suharto the gains
will come from increasing average production to 10 tonnes per
hectare from the previous 6.2 tonnes.
    He said Indonesia is aiming to pass the United States to
become the world's fourth largest producer compared with its
current seventh position.
    Affandi said the increase would insure Indonesia's
self-sufficiency in the commodity and allow it to keep adequate
stocks.
    Indonesia said it produced 2.02 mln tonnes in 1986, but the
U.S. Embassy in its annual agriculture report said output was
1.8 mln tonnes. The U.S. Report forecast no change for 1987.
    Indonesia imported 162,000 tonnes of sugar late last year
and in early 1987 to boost low sugar stocks.
    The country has around 284,000 hectares of sugar cane
farms. The agriculture ministry estimates domestic consumption
at 2.03 mln tonnes in calendar 1987.

<TITLE>JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO LIBERALISE FARM MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm
markets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of
farm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato said.
    He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism
of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.
    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade
talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.
    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme
example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.
Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports
except in emergency.
    Kato said Japanese farmers should however "shed some blood,"
to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.
    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice
Price Council at which the government advisory body will
discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.
    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent
summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in
Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May.
    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need
to cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.
    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect
producers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion
dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export
enhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends
only 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the
world's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per
farm family was several times lower than in the United States.
    Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in
U.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent
farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a
factor increasing protectionism in the United States.
    Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions
at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's
import restrictions on 12 farm items.
    Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period from
next April are due to start this autumn.

<TITLE>TAIWAN PARLIAMENT BACKS FREE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Parliament approved a proposal to drop
all controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that
Taiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the
world economy.
    A government spokesman said the new law would be
promulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and
financial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls
on currency outflows at any time.
    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year
will remain in place, the spokesman said.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls
will be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.
    The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting
currency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have
led to runaway growth in money supply.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade
surplus and the government fears they are making the island a
target for U.S. Trade protectionism.
    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it
was with the United States.
    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the
year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    Local bankers and economists say when the controls are
lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and
invest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations
of a sudden outflow of capital.
    "I don't think we're going to see a big bang," John Brinsden,
the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a
recent interview.
    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast
quantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also
have been freely buying and exporting currency through a
flourishing black-market.
    "Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't
think it's going to be much," said Danny Chan, director of
Fidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.
    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital
outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of
the local currency.
    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the
U.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of
speculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at
31.08.
    The government spokesman said the new law does not empower
authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any
proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of
parliament.
    Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted
it will be almost impossible to reimpose them.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>MAJOR EUROPEAN ZINC SMELTER MERGER SEEN BY 1990</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>There should be at least one merger
between major European zinc smelters before the end of the
decade, Christian Bue, Executive Vice President (commercial) of
SMM Penarroya in France, said.
    Speaking on the second day of the Metal Bulletin base
metals conference, Bue said he expected the current talks
between five smelters including Penarroya to result in
integration between at least some of the companies before 1990.
    The five companies, SMM Penarroya, Outokumpu Oy, Preussag
Ag, Ste de la Vieille Montagne and Boliden Ore and Metals AB,
have 22 pct of the world market, Bue added.
    "We have no alternative than to integrate out businesses
into large trading blocs if we are to survive the cut-throat
price competition and the trend to forward integration from the
mining companies," Bue said.
    "It is by no means certain that all the five companies
involved in the talks will integrate together. It is quite
likely, and even preferable, that the European smelters form
two or three large integrated blocs.
    "In this way we will be better able to negotiate with our
concentrate suppliers on one side, and with the metal buyers on
the other," Bue added.
    In the past, production overcapacity and the intense
competition between the European zinc smelters has meant they
have not only been in a very weak negotiating position when
buying concentrates, but in an even weaker one when selling the
metal, Bue noted.
    Although the apparently easy solution is to simply shut
down excess capacity, the burden of this on individual
companies is far too heavy and no one can be expected to
volunteer, he added.
    Another possible but very risky solution is to invest
heavily in more modern and lower cost facilities, he said.
    "My answer to this suggestion is that individual companies
who do not invest will surely die, and those that do invest
might survive, but only might, " Bue said.
    "The only real option in my mind is integration,
rationalization and stabilization. We have no alternative, " he
added.
    Bue also said that the European smelters were completely
dissatisfied with the tradition of pricing concentrates and
metals in US dollars, and suggested moving either to a basket
of the world's major currencies or pricing in European currency
units (Ecus) to protect against exchange rate volatility.
    Bue's views on integration between European smelters were
met by general approval from the conference audience comprising
representatives from many of the world's major mining, smelting
and trading companies, although some of the mining
representatives were somewhat sceptical in view of their own
industry's move towards integration with smelters.
    However, some concentrate traders did express worry about
their own position if the metals industry does make the move to
large trading blocs.
    The currency basket suggestion cropped up constantly, but
few said they thought matters would change in the near future.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. housing starts fell 2.7 pct in
May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,620,000 units,
the Commerce Department said.
    In April, housing starts fell a revised 3.8 pct to
1,665,000 units. The department previously said they fell 2.9
pct.
    The rate at which permits were issued for future
construction fell in May by 7.6 pct to a seasonally adjusted
1,477,000 units after falling 7.0 pct to 1,598,000 units in
April.
    The department said May housing starts were at the lowest
annual rate since December 1984, when starts were at a
seasonally adjusted 1,612,000 units. The permits total was the
lowest for any month since March 1983, when 1,475,000 permits
were issued.
    Before seasonal adjustment, May housing starts fell to
159,600 units from 161,600 units in April.
    Permits before adjustment fell to 134,800 units in May from
157,000 in April.
    The department said single-family housing starts fell in
May by 7.6 pct to 1,129,000 units from 1,222,000 units in
April. The May decline followed a slight 0.9 pct rise in
single-family starts in April.
    Starts for multi-family units rose 10.8 pct in May to
491,000 units after declining in April by 14.6 pct to 443,000
units.
    Permits for single-family homes in May were down 5.0 pct to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,005,000 units from
1,058,000 units in April. The decline followed a 8.0 pct drop
in single-family permits in April.
    Permits for multi-family units fell in May by 12.6 pct to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 472,000 units from 540,000
units in April. The May decline came after a 5.1 pct drop in
the seasonally adjusted annual rate of permits for multi-family
units in April.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EC COMMISSION MODIFIES OILS TAX PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC Commission has proposed a
modified plan for a tax on marine and vegetable oils and fats
in its revised 1987/88 farm price proposals, an official
document detailing the proposals shows.
    The document, made available to journalists, says the
commission proposes that the tax should start at levels
originally proposed for vegetable oils on October 1.
    However, the tax on marine oils and fats would be cut by 50
pct from originally envisaged levels, the document said.
    In addition, the Commission proposes that the level of the
tax, expected to start at 330 Ecus per tonne, could be reviewed
every three months rather than annually.
    Diplomatic sources said the change to the proposals for
fish oils appears to be an attempt to overcome objections to
the tax from Portugal and Spain, major fishing nations.
    Other countries opposing the tax include Britain, West
Germany and Denmark.
    The new proposals retain most of the Commission's original
plans in other sectors.
    However, they mark the Commission's recognition that it
cannot get proposals to reduce the period of intervention for
cereals, diplomats said.
    Instead the Commission proposes to cut the monthly
increments applied to cereals during the November to May period
when intervention is open to 2.7 Ecus a tonne for durum wheat
and two Ecus a tonne for other cereals.
    The document shows the Commission has also changed its
green currency proposals in the light of heavy opposition,
notably from West Germany.
    West German and Dutch positive monetary compensatory
amounts (MCAs) would be immediately cut by 0.5 points, with a
further one point cut at the beginning of the 1988/89 season.
    The Commission originally proposed a complete dismantling
of positive MCAs.
     For other countries, the Commission makes the following
proposals for dismantling negative MCAs
     Denmark and Benelux - reduction of around 1.5 points for
animal products and just over two points for crops.
     France and Ireland - proposals unchanged except for an
extra 1.5 point cut for beef.
     Italy - dismantling of all MCAs except those created since
January 12.
    Britain - five point cut for most products, 6.5 points for
beef.
    Greece, Spain and Portugal - for most products, dismantling
of seven, 14 and 5.5 points respectively.

    Some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from China, but
the country imports high-grade tungsten products.

    Under the terms of the option agreement, Ansett would have
the right to maintain its 20 pct position in the event of

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOCUSSES ON TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasurer Paul Keating said the
opposition's tax-cutting policy, a key issue in the run up to
the July 11 elections, was a miscalculation that would severely
damage the Australian economy.
    Opposition leader John Howard disputed Keating's
allegations. "Keating is engaged in a desperate, last ditch
panic attempt to deny long-suffering Australian taxpayers the
cuts to which they are entitled," he said.
    Keating said in a radio interview that errors in Howard's
plan, including "double counting," would increase the budget
deficit and could push interest rates above 20 pct.
    Keating said that Treasury officials who had studied
Howard's plans concluded that his proposed tax and spending
cuts would result in a nine billion dlr deficit and damage
international market confidence in Australia.
    In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budget
deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and
three billion dlrs.
    Howard has said a conservative government under his
leadership would reduce the 55 pct top personal and company tax
level to 38 pct and fund the reduction by cutting government
spending.
    Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke have promised not to
increase taxes or impose new ones, but rejected any tax cuts.
Instead they called for wage and other economic restraints to
help overcome balance of payments and foreign debt problems.
    Inflation declined to 9.4 pct for the year to March 31 from
an annual 9.8 pct at the end of the December quarter.
    Hawke has said inflation would fall to six pct by the
middle of next year.
    Australian bank lending rates to best customers have
dropped to around 16.5 pct from a high of 19 pct nine months
ago.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>First City Bancorp of Texas Inc &lt;FBT>
said it was talking with several parties about its previously
announced efforts to bolster its capital position.
    The statement, issued yesterday, did not say how close the
bank was to a merger or recapitalisation program.
    "Several parties have expressed an interest in working with
First City," it said. "This exploration process has not been
completed and therefore it would be premature to speculate on
the alternative that First City might pursue."
 First City had "sufficient time" to find a solution to its
financing problems, the statement added.
    A spokesman said the statement was a response to several
recent inquiries about First City's progress in strengthening
its weak capital position.
    Its problems were caused in part by slumps in Texas real
estate and oil prices.
    First City, which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, had a
first quarter loss of 44.5 mln dlrs. The bank earlier said it
predicted a smaller loss for 1987.
    Banking analysts said First City is unlikely to attract a
suitor unless federal regulators offer buyout assistance. The
company's stock yesterday closed at 2-3/4, down 1/4.

<TITLE>SHULTZ PREDICTS RAPID NARROWING OF U.S. TRADE GAP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of State George Shultz said
the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster
than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade
partners might be traumatic.
    "The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment
necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in
order to service our growing foreign debt," he told a conference
attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.
    "In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many
observers now predict."
    "The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is
becoming less effective," Shultz said.
    "It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the
world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit,
which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which
everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."
    "The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on
this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be
possibly a traumatic experience," he added.
    "While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew
protectionist policies, you must act too," Shultz said.
    "I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave
our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open
their doors wider," he told the group, which included
representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and
the European Community.

<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Barclays Plc &lt;BCS.L> expects the
global travellers cheque industry to grow three to six pct a
year in the next five to 10 years despite growing competition
from credit cards, divisional manager K.S. Nicklin said.
    He said the bank expected the size of the market to
increase to between 39 and 40 billion dlrs in 1987 from 37 to
38 billion in 1986 because of worldwide economic recovery.
    He said China, the Gulf states, South America and Japan
would be areas for growth. Middle-income groups in the U.S. And
Canada would continue to use travellers cheques for overseas
trips rather than credit cards.

<TITLE>UAE LEADERS REJECT OVERTHROW OF SHARJAH RULER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Council of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) has rejected the overthrow of the ruler of the
emirate of Sharjah, the Emirates news agency, WAM, reported.
    The UAE was plunged into a constitutional crisis yesterday
after the ruling family of Sharjah said its ruler Sheikh Sultan
bin Mohammed al-Qassimi had abdicated in favour of one of his
brothers because of financial mismanagement.
    The Council is the highest federal authority in the UAE,
comprising the rulers of the seven emirates which make up the
group, but it has no power over the internal affairs of
individual states, diplomatic sources said.
    The Supreme Council met in emergency session, without a
representative from Sharjah, under the chairmanship of UAE
President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan, WAM said.
    It decided to ignore all statements issued from Sharjah and
would continue meeting until the issue was resolved, the agency
added.
    The Qatar news agency said Sheikh Sultan was in Dubai after
flying back from a private visit to London. The emirate of
Dubai has rejected the Sharjah explanation and said Sheikh
Sultan was ousted by force. It said this was unacceptable and
called for his reinstatement. The UAE was formed in 1971.

<TITLE>DAIRY FARM BIDS 146.6 MLN STG FOR 22 PCT KWIK SAVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings
Ltd> said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct
of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc &lt;KWIK.L> of Britain for a total
146.6 mln stg.
    Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik
Save shares at 4.50 stg each.
    The offer will bring Dairy Farm's stake in Kwik Save to 25
pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares.
    The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30,
requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at
least 15 pct.
    Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing
89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd
&lt;JARS.HK> at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.
    The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy
Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.
    It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a
loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK>. It
did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise
its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.
    Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the
proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office
building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.
    It will consider raising additional capital, most probably
through a placement of convertible preference shares in the
Euromarket, it added.
    Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market "offers
attractive opportunities for competitively priced food
retailers" and that "a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers
the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities."

<TITLE>JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
    The officials said corn imports rose because the world
surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
from 2.1 pct.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia said
it will lower its reference rate for loans to 15.75 pct from
16.25 pct and its overdraft reference rate to 16.25 pct from
16.75, effective June 24.
    Bank officials have said the bank regards the overdraft
reference rate, based on short-term rate trends, as its key
prime lending rate to corporate customers. The loan reference
rate is based on longer term trends.
    The bank is the latest to cut prime rates in recent days
following a continuing decline in market rates. Other prime
rates now range from 16 pct to 17.5 pct.

bullion coins at the Perth Mint, Treasurer Paul Keating said.
    This followed the success of the Australian Nugget gold
bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.
    He said that, as with the Australian nuggets, the coins
would be legal tender. The platinum coins would be made in four
weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.
    He said detailed arrangements for their issue would be
finalised after talks between the Federal authorities and the
Western Australian government, owner of the Perth Mint.

<TITLE>S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's gross national product (GNP)
will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise
further as long as the current account surplus continues to
widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.
    Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his
GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will
remain stable.
    The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.
    GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and
1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.
    GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.
    In the first four months of this year, the current account
swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294
mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.
    "What the Minister said does not imply any major economic
policy change," a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. "But he tried
to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic
(future) ... A high won era."
    South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won
should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they
plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation
against the dollar.
    The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05
against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared
with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.
    The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three
days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund
team held talks here to discuss revaluation.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND FORECASTS 379 MLN DLR BUDGET SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New Zealand government is
forecasting a budget surplus of 379 mln N.Z. Dlrs for the year
ending March 1988, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said in a
statement.
    This compares with a deficit of 1.95 billion dlrs in the
year ending March 1987 and a 1.87 billion dlr deficit a year
earlier.
    Total expenditure is seen at 22.907 billion dlrs against
20.94 billion in the year to end-March 1987. Total revenue is
seen at 23.29 billion dlrs against 18.992 billion.
    The forecast rise in revenue comes partly from the 10 pct
value added goods and services Tax (GST) introduced in October
1986 which is seen bringing in 4.1 billion dlrs against 1.23
billion a year earlier.
    Other indirect taxation is seen rising to 3.1 billion dlrs
from 2.2 billion. Company tax is forecast to bring in 2.39
billion dlrs against 1.22 billion a year earlier while the tax
take from individuals is seen little changed at 10.7 billion
dlrs against 10.9 billion.
    Excluding revenue and expenditure of a capital nature, such
as repayment of loans by state-owned enterprises or revenue
from asset sales, the budget would indicate a deficit of 1.27
billion dlrs, Douglas said
    Using this "financial deficit" method the deficit in the year
to end March 1987 was 1.89 billion dlrs, he said.
    Douglas said using this method, the financial deficit
forecast for 1987/88 measures 2.2 pct of gross domestic product
against 6.9 pct a year earlier.

<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian crude oil and condensate
output fell 7.6 pct to 23,480 megalitres, or about 147 mln
barrels, in the first nine months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June
30, the Department of Resources and Energy said.
    The decline in production in the nine months to end-March
reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low
oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of
output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy
Statistics publication show.
    A megalitre is 6,290 barrels.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand will repay a portion of
its 42.48 billion N.Z. Dlr public debt for the first time since
1952 as a result of a 379 mln N.Z. Dlr budget surplus for
fiscal March 1988, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.
    Douglas said in a budget statement the surplus is the first
achieved in New Zealand in 35 years. It compared with a 1.95
billion dlr deficit in fiscal 1987.
    Douglas said this year's government bond tender program
would be adjusted in the light of the surplus, providing for
the repayment of up to 600 mln dlrs of New Zealand's 21.74
billion dlrs of overseas debt.
    Details of which loans will be repaid have still to be
decided.
    Douglas said the present scale of the public debt was
massive.
    "It will take many years to reduce the debt to an acceptable
level," he said.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A forecast 379 mln N.Z. Dlr surplus
in the government's 1987/88 budget will allow a significant
reduction in the government debt program, Finance Minister
Roger Douglas said in a statement.
    "There are however good reasons to maintain a higher
borrowing program than the Budget numbers require," he said.
    The government will borrow a further 950 mln dlrs this
fiscal year, down from the further 1.75 billion originally
planned.
    "The amount of foreign currency debt generated by previous
economic mismanagement is too large," Douglas said. "It would not
be sensible when presented with an opportunity to repay some
debt to do so only in respect of domestic debt."
    The government also has an interest in keeping enough of a
domestic borrowing program going to keep the secondary market
efficient, he said. That will give the government better
borrowing terms in future, he added.
    Douglas said the revised debt program also meant the
government would be able to retire over 650 mln dlrs of
domestic debt and 600 mln dlrs of foreign debt.

<TITLE>BERISFORD SIX PCT PROFIT RISE MAINTAINS MOMENTUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>S and W Berisford Plc &lt;BRFD.L> said a six
pct rise in pretax profits to 42.7 mln stg in the first half
had maintained last year's momentum despite poor commodities
trading conditions and continued rationalisation costs.
    Its British Sugar Corp Plc unit produced its best ever
performance due to greater efficiency and better selling prices
and was on course for record full year profits.
    In the last year Berisford attempted to sell the unit and
attracted several bids. A bid by Hillsdown Holdings Plc
&lt;HLDN.L> was abandoned, one from Tate and Lyle Plc &lt;TATL.L>
officially blocked and a sale of BSC to &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> also
prevented.
    It had authorised a further 46 mln stg in capital
expenditure in BSC for next year, eight mln higher than the
anticipated total this year.
    Berisford said it was particularly pleased with the
progress of its associate Hunter Saphir Plc, in which it
acquired a substantial equity stake in January in return for
the sale of some of its food manufacturing companies.
    Since the deal was completed, the market value of the stake
in Hunter had almost doubled and at the same time enabled the
group to concentrate efforts in its food division on
ingredients -- mainly sugar, gelatine and flavours.
    The property division maintained good growth while
financial services made a satisfactory contribution to profits.
However, the results of the industrial division continued to be
disappointing although the rationalisation programme was
progressing well.
    Commodity operations returned to profit after a second half
loss last year. The results reflected dull market conditions,
with coffee trading failing to repeat last year's exceptional
first half performance due to extremely difficult conditions in
world markets.
    It said it was reducing its exposure to the volatility of
commodity earnings by concentrating on a smaller range of key
commodities.
    Berisford shares firmed one penny on the announcement to
366p.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Members of the Bull Moose coking coal mine
in British Columbia, Canada, agreed to cut the base price they
charge Japanese steelmakers to 91.77 Canadian dlrs a tonne FOB
for the year from April 1, down 14 dlrs from 1986/87, an
official at a company involved in the deal said.
    The Nippon Kokan KK &lt;NKKT.T> official said the cut was
agreed after five months of talks between &lt;Teck Corp>, &lt;Rornex
Mining Corp Ltd> and &lt;Nissho Iwai Coal Development (Canada)
Ltd>.
    He said the Japanese side would continue to ask the miners
to improve the quality of Bull Moose coal's ash specification.
    Japanese steel mills and several Canadian exporters
including the sellers of Bull Moose coal have had several
rounds of negotiations on coking coal base prices this year,
industry sources said.
    The Japanese steel firms started a new round of base price
talks with &lt;Quintette Coals Ltd> yesterday, while discussions
with &lt;Gregg River Co Ltd> will be held later this month, they
said.
    Nissho Iwai Coal is a unit of &lt;Nissho Iwai Corp> of Japan.

Ltd> obtained a 1.2 billion H.K. Dlr loan from the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp to finance its tender offer for a 22 pct
stake in Kwik Save Discount Group Plc &lt;KWIK>, Dairy Farm
chairman Simon Keswick told reporters.
    He did not disclose the terms of the loan but said they
were "fairly fair."
    Dairy Farm said earlier in a statement it would offer to
buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik Save shares at 4.50 stg each, raising
its stake in the retail firm to 25 pct from 3.5 pct now.
    Keswick said Dairy Farm wanted to obtain at least 15 pct of
Kwik Save, which would make it Kwik Save's biggest shareholder,
otherwise it would dispose of its entire stake.
    Kwik Save opened at 4.45 stg, up from yesterday's 3.90 stg
close.

<TITLE>GOVERNMENT TO SELL 25 PCT OF AIR NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New Zealand Government will sell
25 pct of state-owned &lt;Air New Zealand Ltd> to the public,
Civil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said.
    Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an
adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the
timing of any sales and the price.
    "Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other
proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best
opportunity," Prebble said.
    "We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New
Zealand," he said.
    "Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that
means waiting for a while, then so be it," Prebble said.
    He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon
for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it
would post an excellent profit.
    Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability
to prosper in future was hampered by its
wholly-government-owned status.
    Prebble said access to new sources of capital would
increase its ability to expand and develop.
    This sale announcement follows the public float in March of
around 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.
    The government has said it will also float part of the
capital of other state-owned operations, including &lt;DFC New
Zealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand
Ltd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.

<TITLE>JAPAN FINISHING UP WORK ON SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry is putting the
finishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary
budget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to
next year's main budget, ministry officials said.
    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the
6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government
unveiled last month to boost domestic demand.
    Ministry officials said the government would issue about
1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the
increased public investment set out in the emergency package.
    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by
450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than
expected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.
    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the
1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than
1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boosted
receipts, especially from securities and land taxes.
    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in
the current supplementary budget, the rest will be available
for a second supplementary budget expected later this year.
    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the
government's wage bill, which will not be known until after
wage talks later this year, one official said.
    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than
1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package
but which will not be contained in the first supplementary
budget, due to be presented to parliament next month.
    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax
carry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year
will be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he
said.
    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue
deficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this
year's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.
    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also
intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during
the upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.
    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform
bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five
pct sales tax.
    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in
individual and corporate income taxes.
    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax
cut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an
overhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.
    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax
breaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October
as originally planned, they said.
    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance
Ministry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its
so-called minus ceiling for public investment.
    That policy calls on government departments to cut public
investment spending by five pct per year.
    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the
policy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation
from the government's administrative reform council.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that
budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be
reviewed.
    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau
said they were hopeful the policy would be retained.
    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public
investment could lead to increased pressure on the government
to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.
    The account would also extend interest-free loans to
profitable public works projects developed in conjunction with
the private sector, the officials said.
    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing
pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a
tight grip on outlays by other government departments.
    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could
total about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market
price, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more
than 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned
for in the main 1987/88 budget.

- A spokesman for pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo Holdings Plc
&lt;GLXO.L> said he had no knowledge of a bearish U.S. Press
article which London share dealers said has helped depress the
shares in early trading here.
    Glaxo shares fell to a low of 1,725 this morning after
heavy selling in the U.S. Overnight on rumours the New England
Medical Journal had published an article critical of the "Zantac"
anti ulcer drug. The shares later rallied to stand 34p down at
1,751.
    Dealers said the share price move was also based on profit
taking after yesterday's rise on bullish remarks from chairman
Paul Girolami and the shares' debut on the Tokyo market.

<TITLE>BANK OF FINLAND PREDICTS 1987 INVESTMENT SURGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finnish industrial investment will rise
10 pct in 1987 from last year reaching its highest rate since
1980, the Bank of Finland's two year survey predicted.
    Investment will centre on machinery and equipment, with a
rise of almost 25 pct.
    There will almost be a rise of 20 pct in investment in
manufacturing, with notable growth in the paper industry,
chemicals, building materials and consumer goods sectors.
    The rate of growth will fall back in 1988 with spending
remaining at the same level as this year, the survey said.
    Research and development spending will show a rise of over
three billion markka, representing 18 pct of investment in
1987.
    Finland's investment rate is high internationally as the
share of capital intensive industries is relatively large.
    "But the quicker growth of Finnish industrial production is
also an indication investments are promoting a renovation and
increase in production capacity," the survey said.
    Manufacturing industry would have a capacity use rate of 86
pct at the end of 1987, one pct above the rate at the start of
the year. This was expected to grow further next year, it said.

than expected results for the year to March showed that its
strategy was working. BET raised pretax profits in the year to
157.4 mln stg from 124.6 mln previously.
    It had continued to build on a range of complementary
services through a combination of organic growth and carefully
targetted acquisitions.
    A company statement said it was confident that the figures
would provide an effective springboard for the broadening of
its shareholder base, particularly through the issue of
American Depositary Receipts in the U.S. Later this year.
    BET also said it was appointing Sir Timothy Bevan, formerly
chairman of Barclays Plc to replace Sir Hugh Dundas when he
retires as Chairman in December.
    BET's net debt fell four pct in the year to 262 mln stg
with gearing down to 63 pct from 65 pct.
    Returns on assets, sales  and capital employed showed
further improvement in the period.
    BET shares at 0907 GMT were quoted at 291p, one penny
firmer on last night's close.

<TITLE>EC FARM MINISTERS END MEETING WITHOUT PRICE ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community farm ministers
plunged the bloc into a crisis today by ending a marathon
negotiation on 1987/88 farm prices without agreement.
    Their chairman, Belgian Paul de Keersmaeker, told a press
conference this morning ministers gave a majority vote in
favour of all aspects of an EC Commission compromise proposal
introduced on Tuesday.
    However, the minority against the crucial plan for a tax on
vegetable and marine oils and fats was big enough to block its
adoption, and British Agriculture Minister John MacGregor said
other aspects of the proposals are likely to be vetoed.
    MacGregor said the meeting foundered in part because of an
implicit indication from the West Germans that they were
prepared to veto two other aspects of the package, the future
monetary compensatory amounts system and proposals directly
connected with common prices.
    De Keersmaeker said he will now consider when ministers
should be called for further talks, but diplomats said the
outcome of the meeting makes it almost certain the major
outstanding issues will be referred to EC heads of government
who hold a summit meeting on June 29 and 30 in Brussels.
    A Commission official said the Commission will work out
stopgap measures which it will bring in on July 1 if the
deadlock persists. These will concern products such as cereals,
colza, sugar, beef and milk, for which there would otherwise be
no legal EC regulations from that date.
    Trade sources expect these will include a seven pct cut in
guaranteed prices for most cereals.
    The official said the measures "will take into account the
situation in the market, but also the EC's severe budgetary
situation."
    The Commission was expecting an EC budget deficit this year
of almost six billion dlrs even before it presented its
compromise, which would have cost almost one billion more. It
estimates the oils and fats tax would bring in 2.3 billion dlrs
in a full year.
    Diplomats said Britain, West Germany and the Netherlands
maintained their opposition to the tax despite Commission
attempts to persuade them it would not unfairly hit exports
from countries outside the EC.
    They added Denmark did not formally state its final
position but was understood to remain against.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND TO CLOSE TAX LOOPHOLES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Roger Douglas said
New Zealand would enact legislation to prevent local companies
and individuals from using overseas tax havens.
    The government would also outlaw the practice of double
deduction of losses by dual resident companies, known as "double
dipping," Douglas said in a budget statement.
    The anti-tax-haven legislation would affect non-resident
entities, such as companies and trusts, set up in low tax
countries and earning mainly passive investment income, Douglas
said.
    A consultative document will be released in September
explaining the proposed legislation, and a consultative
committee will then receive public submissions and advise the
government on implementation, Douglas said.
    The legislation would attack tax avoidance but not genuine
business activity, he added.
    He said some New Zealand residents were avoiding New
Zealand tax entirely by setting up non-resident entities in tax
havens, which intercepted and gathered income taxable in New
Zealand.
    In a move to counter "double dipping," the government would
no longer allow dual resident companies to group their losses,
Douglas said.
    The proposed legislation would require them to carry tax
losses forward to be offset against future profits, effective
for income years starting after December 17, 1986.

<DATELINE>    BOMBAY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The state-owned Industrial Development
Bank of India (IDBI) has given &lt;Morgan Guaranty Ltd, Hong Kong>
the mandate to arrange a 10 billion yen loan in Japan, a senior
IDBI official told Reuters.
    The 15-year loan, to be signed next month, carries interest
pegged to the Japanese long-term prime rate, now at around five
pct per annum, said the official who declined to be named.
    The loan will be IDBI's first foreign currency borrowing
for the financial year beginning July 1, 1987, he said without
specifying IDBI's total targetted borrowings for the year.
    IDBI, which has raised 85 mln dlrs in Euroloans and 100 mln
Swiss Francs in 1986/87, first entered the Japanese market in
1984/85 by raising two loans of five billion yen each, followed
by a 10 billion Euroyen loan last year.
    IDBI lends foreign currency funds to local industrial
borrowers to help them import capital goods.
    Bankers said the Industrial Credit and Investment Corp of
India, India's only private sector financial institution, is
holding talks with foreign banks on arranging a loan of 10
billion yen. They said India's commercial borrowings in 1987/88
may remain at the 1986/87 level of 1.5 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>TOSHIBA, SHARP RESTRAIN LAP-TOP PC EXPORTS TO EC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp
&lt;SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal
computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,
despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen
told Reuters.
    They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting
EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans
feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after
Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.
    Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the
personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.
    Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers
would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.
    Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top
personal computers would continue at last year's level of
12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
    Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged
failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.

<TITLE>BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian National Bank said it cut
one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by
0.10 points, effective immediately.
    The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month
rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the
central bank said in a telex.
    A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made
after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and
was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct
discount rate.
    The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially
the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main
monetary policy instrument for the last two years.
    The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather
than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently
little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.
    The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on
June 5, also by 0.10 points.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Aramco Corp> has accepted Japanese
nominations to lift a higher proportion of Arab Heavy crude oil
under term contracts in July, oil industry sources said.
    Japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct Arab Heavy
to 20 pct Arab Light under a term contract agreement with
Aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. The
contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.
    Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased
substantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing
into the northern Mideast gulf last month, causing problems
with liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes.

has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oil
supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July,
a spokesman for an affiliated company said.
    He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's
production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might
be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week.
    Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had
been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said.
    Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.
    Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.
    Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading
above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market
due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight
supplies.
    A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded
yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 15.60 dlrs per barrel and
Minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Vietnam's parliament sacked Prime
Minister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, but the
choice of their successors indicated the influence of the old
guard may not be over, diplomatic sources said.
    Dong, prime minister for 32 years, left in fading health at
the age of 81. He is a popular hero of wars against France and
the United States and a staunch ally of the Soviet Union.
    Parliament replaced him with second-ranked politburo member
Pham Hung, 74, the Vietnam News Agency said. Hung headed the
Viet Cong guerrillas in the Vietnam War.
    Diplomats in Bangkok said Hung, not a noted supporter of
economic and political reforms, had been widely tipped for the
less important presidency.
    That post went instead to Vo Chi Cong, a technocrat who
ranks third in the politburo. Diplomatic sources said Cong was
more in tune with the national economic and political changes
being pushed by reformists who apparently had gained the upper
hand in the all-important politburo in December.
    Chinh, a hardline Marxist and a veteran of the wars against
France and the U.S., Was ousted at the age of 80. His political
stance had recently softened, the sources said.

<TITLE>MAZDA SEES 50.8 PCT DROP IN 1986/87 CURRENT PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mazda Motor Corp &lt;MAZT.T> predicted a
parent company current profit of 10 billion yen in the year
ending October 31, 1987, down 50.8 pct from a year earlier,
assuming a yen/dollar value at 147 yen, vice president
Yoshihiro Wada told a press conference.
    Sales in 1986/87 were estimated at 1,640 billion yen, up
0.9 pct from a year earlier.
    The company earlier posted a parent net profit of 1.59
billion in the first half ended April 30, down 76.9 pct from a
year earlier, on sales of 804.02 billion, down 4.2 pct.
    The fall was due to the yen rise against the dollar which
cut 55 billion yen off sales, Wada said. The average value of
the dollar was 155 yen in the period from 190 a year earlier.
    Mazda estimated vehicle exports at 1.12 mln, including kit
parts, in the year to October 31, up 6.8 pct from a year
earlier, and domestic sales at 360,000, up 0.8 pct, he said.
    Kit exports should rise because kits sold to Kia Motor Corp
&lt;KIAM.SE> unit &lt;Kia Industrial Corp>, which is eight pct owned
by Mazda, and to a Mexico unit of Ford Motor Co &lt;F> will rise
to 150,000 from 9,000, pushing kit exports up 45.3 pct to
260,000, he said.
    Mazda has yet to decide whether to pay an unchanged four
yen dividend for the second half, but it will pay an unchanged
3.50 yen for the first half, Wada said.

francs in May to 420.50 billion francs from 420.24 billion at
the end of April, the Finance Ministry said.
    The slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month
of France's outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to
the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
    It also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with
France's Exchange Stabilisation Fund after intervention
purchases of 10.6 billion francs during May.
    Foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to
124.58 billion while ECU holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs
to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of France's debt
owed to the FECOM and Stabilisation Fund operations, the
ministry said.
    Claims on the IMF rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97
billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in France's reserve
position with the IMF and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of
Special Drawing Rights.
    Gold holdings were unchanged at 218.46 billion francs.

<TITLE>FRENCH STATE SELL-OFFS RAISE 52 BILLION FRANCS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French government's privatisation
program, which began late last year, has earned the French
State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry
said.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the
revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
at the end of 1986.
    The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included
banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its
two-week public flotation last Monday.
    The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation
scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers
Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, it added.
    The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
    Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
near future are television network TF-1 later this month and
banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA> in the autumn.
    The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
third of the government's programme would have been completed
in less than nine months.
    Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges
that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
too low.
    He said that the average premium of shares trading on the
Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This
compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
share flotations in Britain.

<TITLE>FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SUVA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
crop year.
    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
486,790 tonnes.
    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
by June 23.
    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
harvested by November 30, he said.
    Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance of
the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
end of crushing."
    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
The FDB rejected this request.
    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully
consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
hardship on a case-by-case basis."
    In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
commencement of harvest.
    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
he added.

<TITLE>JAPAN INSTITUTIONS EYEING T-BOND INVESTMENT WARILY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ayumu Murano, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some major Japanese institutional
investors are gradually returning to investing in U.S.
Treasuries, although fear that the dollar has not yet bottomed
out has kept others cautiously waiting on the sidelines.
    Trust banks and some investment trusts are starting to look
at buying treasuries for short-term gains, while other
investment trusts and most life insurers are still wary,
according to fund managers polled by Reuters.
    The five percentage point gap between U.S. And Japanese
long-term bonds is the major attraction of T-bonds.
    Most institutions remain sensitive to the prospects of
dollar declines, after making huge foreign exchange losses on
their foreign bond holdings last fiscal year ended March.
    The seven leading local life insurers alone saw losses on
their foreign bond holdings of over 1,700 billion yen, or some
11.5 billion dlrs, in 1986/87, industry sources said.
    However, most institutional investors want to buy U.S.
T-bonds due to the absence of profitable domestic instruments.
    "Despite all the negative factors, we have definite demand
for U.S. Securities," said Osamu Fukushima, deputy manager of
Mitsui Trust and Banking Co Ltd's securities department.
    Another trust bank fund manager said, "What matters the most
are the fundamentals of the U.S. Economy and the
competitiveness of U.S. Industry. We are closely watching the
growth of U.S. Exports, which is an important measure of the
fundamental strength of the dollar." The U.S. Trade deficit's
decline in April was due to a 1.2 billion dlr decline in
imports, while exports did not show a recovery, he said.
    One life insurance company fund manager said, "We doubt the
U.S. Government will fight the trade and fiscal deficits,
especially after the announcement of Federal Reserve Board
chairman Paul Volcker's resignation."
    "The receptive stance of the U.S. Congress on the call for
further dollar falls to cut the country's trade deficit also
makes us wary about U.S. Bonds purchases," the life insurance
company fund manager said.
    Yuji Miyaji, deputy manager of the Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co Ltd's securities investment department, said, "We are
slowly starting to buy U.S. Bonds because the gap of over 500
basis points between the U.S. And Japan is very attractive
However, we are pessimistic on the dollar's further recovery.
We find that U.S. Economic fundamentals have not changed so
far."
    Keijirou Fukushima, manager at Yamaichi Investment Trust
Management Co Ltd's bond portfolio management department, said,
"We would like to invest in U.S. Bonds gradually, given an
improved inflation outlook and the limited chances of a further
steep fall in the dollar from now."
    "We have already reduced forward dollar selling volume to 40
pct of our total foreign assets from 60 pct," he said.
    Another life insurance company fund manager said, "We have
started investing in U.S. Treasury securities, but only on a
trading basis."

<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Unemployment fell a record
provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in May to a total 2.95
mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department
said.
    In April, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an
upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said.
    The unadjusted jobless total in May, including school
leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct
from April's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct.
    May was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last
summer of 11.6 pct, the Employment Department said.
    "Unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first
time in over three years. The May fall of 64,000 was the
largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948),"
Employment Minister Norman Fowler said.
    All regions have seen above average falls in long term
unemployment during the past year, he added.
    The last time the adjusted total of unemployed was below
three mln was July 1984, while the unadjusted total was last
below this level in June 1983.

adjusted 6.5 pct in the year to end-April, after increasing by
6.7 pct annually in March, the Employment Department said.
    The April index, base 1980, was set at a provisional,
seasonally-adjusted 197.3, up from 194.8 in March.
    But the underlying rise was 7.75 pct, up 0.25 pct from
March and back to the same level seen late last year.
    The underlying rise is adjusted for factors such as
back-pay and timing variations.
    Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose one pct
in the year to April, after an upward revised rise of 0.7 pct
in the period to March, the Department of Employment added.
    In the three months to end-April, such costs were 0.9 pct
higher, year-on-year, compared with a rise of 1.2 pct in the
three months to March.
    Manufacturing productivity in April was 6.1 pct higher than
a year ago after a downward revised 6.8 pct increase in March.
In the last three months period manufacturing productivity was
up 6.7 pct, having increased 6.5 pct in the first quarter.

<TITLE>U.K. CLEARING BANK LENDING RISES SHARPLY IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, May 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Clearing bank sterling lending to the
private sector in May is estimated to have risen by an
underlying, seasonally adjusted 3.5 billion stg compared with
1.3 billion stg in April and a recent monthly average of 1.4
billion, the Banking Information Service said.
    The unadjusted rise was 2.77 billion stg, up from 844 mln
in April.
    The May surge in borrowing from the clearing banks was
prompted by the fall in base rates, which reached nine pct on
May 11, the Banking Information Service said. Borrowing through
bill finance and other sources shrank.
    The increase in lending in May was seen in most categories,
the Banking Information Service said.
    In the personal sector, on an unadjusted basis, mortgage
lending rose 544 mln stg compared with 471 mln in April.
General consumption went up 399 mln against 355 mln, though
credit card debt rose only 55 mln compared with 161 mln.
    Financial sector borrowing was up 734 mln stg in May
compared with a net repayment of 60 mln the previous month.
    Unadjusted private sector deposits increased by 2.37
billion stg against 1.16 billion. Sterling attracted an extra
955 mln stg in deposits from abroad after little change in
April.

<TITLE>INVESTIGATORS SAY AIR LANKA LOSSES DEVASTATING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marilyn Odchimar, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A commission set up to unravel the
affairs of debt-ridden Air Lanka says the airline amassed
losses of up to 265 mln U.S. Dlrs in "the most devastating
financial tragedy" in Sri Lankan commercial history.
    The commission, which scrutinised financial dealings from
aircraft acquisitions to give-away cookbooks, blamed the
airline's previous board for the losses. The panel, appointed
in August by President Junius Jayewardene, submitted its report
to him on April 20. A copy was obtained by Reuters. The report
will be made available to the public by next week.
    The three-man commission recommended its findings be passed
to state law officers to decide whether penal action was
necessary against any members of the former board or Air
Lanka's management. The airline comes under the Defence
Ministry, a portfolio held by Jayewardene himself.
    The commission said Air Lanka's reports to Jayewardene
"blurred" its true financial health. It said the airline had
irretrievably lost its share capital of 3.8 billion rupees.
    To finance deficits, it had also used up a treasury loan of
800 mln rupees and part of foreign currency loans obtained for
aircraft purchases and infrastructure needs, it said.
    "Air Lanka is thus indebted to overseas lenders to the value
of one billion rupees without any productive assets or
collateral to provide for its repayment," the commission said.
    It said the airline's losses were assessed at 5.59 billion
rupees at March 31, 1986. But cumulative losses would reach 7.7
billion, implying Air Lanka lost money at the rate of 1.3
billion rupees a year between 1979, when it started, and 1986.
    "These results must rank as the most devastating financial
tragedy ever suffered in Sri Lanka's commercial history," the
commission said.
    The report said the airline's dangerously critical
financial condition was due to uncontrolled spending --
particularly the way in which the airline expanded its fleet --
poor marketing, and extreme laxity in cost controls.
    "It is clear to us that Air Lanka's misfortunes are largely
of its own creation and that the reponsibility must rest
primarily with the board of directors," it said.
    Air Lanka had blamed its problems on the effects on tourism
of Sri Lanka's Tamil separatist rebellion, the depreciating
rupee and under-capitalisation. The commission dismissed these
as invalid.
    The report said most of the major problems stemmed from
concentration of power by Captain S.R. Wikramanayake who held
the posts of both chairman and managing director.
    "It is mainly he who has to be responsible for whatever the
status of Air Lanka is in today," it said.
    Wikramanayake resigned with the other board members last
November. He could not be contacted for comment.
    The commission recommended that its findings should be
passed "to the law officers of the state ... To ascertain if
penal action is necessary against any or all members of the
former board of Air Lanka or its management staff."
    The panel recommended equity involvement of one or more
foreign airlines in Air Lanka and the granting of maximum
concessions to make the carrier attractive to foreign and local
investment. It also suggested selling assets, such as two
Boeing 747s financed by U.S. Dollar loans, to reduce debt.
    It said Air Lanka and the government should renegotiate
U.S. Dollar-denominated debts into other currencies which form
the core of earnings and obtain lower interest rates. It also
proposed negotiations for the return of two Lockheed Tristar
L1011-500s now leased to British Airways before the leases
expire next March.

<TITLE>ZURICH FAVOURS TIGHT "MONEY LAUNDERING" LAW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cantonal government of Zurich wants a
proposed federal law making "money laundering" an offence to
punish negligence and not just gross negligence, the cantonal
information service said.
    The Zurich authorities said they supported proposals
unveiled by the federal government in February to make it a
crime for anyone to conceal the origin of money which they have
reason to believe was obtained by criminal means.
    But they argued in a submission on the proposals that the
duty of care imposed on financial institutions should make them
liable for any negligence.
    The federal government's proposals, which are being
circulated for comment before a formal bill is put before
parliament, would make only gross negligence an offence.
    The new legislation, which is aimed mainly at combatting
organised crime, is likely to take effect in the early 1990s.

<TITLE>BANKAMERICA ASKS JAPAN BANKS TO BUY SECURITIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp &lt;BAC> asked Japanese
commercial banks today to buy 350 mln dlrs in subordinated
capital notes and preferred stock that it plans to issue to
boost its equity base, a company spokesman said.
    BankAmerica vice chairman Frank N. Newman held a meeting
here today to outline its fund-raising plan to some 20 Japanese
banks, he told Reuters.
    He also stressed the company's efforts to streamline
operations, by withdrawing from unprofitable energy-related
areas to concentrate more on its Californian home base.
    But Newman said the company had no intention of selling its
 Seafirst Corp Subsidiary in Washington.
    A document obtained by Reuters shows the fund-raising
effort involves 250 mln dlrs in 12-year subordinated capital
notes and 100 mln in convertible preferred stock.
    It has made a shelf registration with the SEC so that it
can issue debt securities whenever market conditions are
favorable.
    The company already raised 100 mln dlrs in the U.S. Market
last month, he added.
    According to the document, the 250 mln dlrs in subordinated
capital notes will carry an interest rate of 100 basis points
over the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The
minimum rate will be six pct and the maxiumum 12 pct.
    The notes will be redeemable at par after four years and
will also have warrants attached to purchase the firm's common
stock at 17.50 dlrs. There will be 7.5 mln warrants in all,
with a term of 10 years.
    The planned convertible preferred stock will carry a
dividend rate equivalent to three months LIBOR plus an as yet
undecided premium, the document said. There will be no sinking
fund for the preferred stock, which will have 10-year warrants
attached to buy BankAmerica common stock.
    The rest of the details of the preferred stock issue have
yet to be worked out.
    On both the preferred stock and note issues, BankAmerica
said that a fixed rate alternative was possible.
    The document said that BankAmerica was also open to raising
funds in yen, if that was desirable for the Japanese.
    Those present at the meeting today were working-level
officials from 13 city, three long-term credit and seven trust
banks, Japanese banking sources said.
    Newman expressed hope that certain banks would act as lead
managers of the projected debt securities but did not name
specific banks, the sources said. No bank made any commitment
to the company's fund-raising plan as most knew little about it
in advance, they said.
    "Today's meeting itself was held with very short-notice and
we just can't decide what to do with it," said a senior official
at a leading city bank.
    Newman attempted to quell Japanese bankers' fears that the
U.S. Federal Reserve may insist that they deduct the equivalent
amount to the securities purchased  from their primary capital,
under a regulation now being studied by the U.S. And Britain.
    Newman told them that they should not worry because he
understood the U.S. Federal Reserve would not go along with
such a regulation, the official said.

    The new rate, if unmatched by other banks, will be the
lowest among Australian trading banks. Other primes range from
16.25 to 17.5 pct.
    Australian prime rates have now retreated from a recent
peak of 19 pct in October in line with declining money market
levels. Citibank said its reduction reflected the decline.

<TITLE>J. HARDIE SAYS HIGHER NET REFLECTS RATIONALISATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>James Hardie Industries Ltd &lt;HAHA.S> said
the 28 pct increase in its 1986/87 net profit reflected the
benefits of continuing rationalisation and consolidation of
Australian activities and expansion in the U.S.
    The diversified building products group reported net
earnings rose to 60.58 mln dlrs in the year ended March 31 from
47.42 mln in 1985/86. It lifted annual dividend to 24 cents
from 22 with a final of 13, against 11 previously.
    Hardie had concentrated resources on building up its core
businesses of building products, paper merchanting and
technology and services, it said in a statement.
    Hardie said it sold a number of businesses during the year
which were unable to meet objectives for return on investment
or market share and some non-core units.
    This resulted in a decline in sales to 1.50 billion dlrs
from 1.56 billion, but also contributed to a fall of about 100
mln dlrs in borrowings by year-end and a 36 pct drop in
interest expense to 29.16 mln dlrs, it said.
    Hardie said a 42 pct jump in second-half net earnings to
29.66 mln dlrs from 20.92 mln a year earlier was particularly
pleasing in view of the difficult trading conditions faced by
the building products businesses in Australia.
    The problems in U.S. Irrigation operations which adversely
affected 1985/86 earnings have been overcome, Hardie said.
    It said the process of rationalisation and consolidation
had continued into the current year as had expansion into the
U.S.
    Hardie said it could now look forward to a period of
development and further growth in Australia and overseas after
carrying through a long and expensive process of eliminating
asbestos, the group's original prime raw material, from its
fibre cement building products over the past eight years.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Average spending by French ministries will
be virtually frozen next year within the framework of a one pct
real increase in the overall state budget, sources close to
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.
    The sources said priority would be given to defence,
research and the fight against unemployment, which reached 2.66
mln people in April.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac yesterday chaired a
ministerial meeting on the budget and Balladur is due to make
the final decision at the end of the month.
    Budget Minister Alain Juppe said yesterday that the
government was on course to achieve its target of tax cuts
worth 50 billion francs over two years.
    Juppe gave no details but pledged that the government also
planned to cut its budget deficit down to 115 billion francs by
1988 from the 129 billion franc shortfall forecast for 1987.

it will lower its reference rate for loans to 15.75 pct from

    Bank officials have said the bank regards the overdraft
reference rate, based on short-term rate trends, as its key
prime lending rate to corporate customers. The loan reference
rate is based on longer term trends.
    The bank is the latest to cut prime rates in recent days
following a continuing decline in market rates. Other prime
rates now range from 16 pct to 17.5 pct.

<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch parliamentary parties have
re-affirmed their support for the government's opposition to
the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats,
parliamentarians said.
    A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their
opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house
yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S.
And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World
countries.
    State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden
said the government was against the tax although it noted
deepening EC financial difficulties.
    "It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra
finance. The EC members have to make a choice," Van Der Linden
said.
    However, he denied the government had dropped its
opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.

<TITLE>SANDVIK, DIAMANT BOART FINALISE DRILLS MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's Sandvik AB &lt;SVIK.ST> and
Diamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de
Belgique &lt;BELB.BR> holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have
finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool
activities, officials of both companies said.
    Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint
venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news
conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products
for all types of drilling operations.
    He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from
recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.
    "Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"
Paues said.
    DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings
together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp
of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,
North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.
    Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

<TITLE>CANADA SEES GLOBAL ACTION TO REDUCE FARM SUBSIDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's Foreign Minister Joe Clark
said there is greater international recognition on the need to
reduce government-imposed subsidies on agricultural produce.
    "There is now recognition that agricultural subsidies must
be reduced, and other reform measures pursued," Clark told a
conference of ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)
foreign ministers and their counterparts from six
industrialised countries.
    A delegate said Clark's call for "halting the subsidy war in
the agricultural products" to ensure a stable world trading
system received warm support from Japan and Australia.
    Clark said the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) has called for "reduction of direct and
indirect subsidies and avoidance of predatory or protectionist
trade practices."
    The OECD stand was endorsed by the Venice economic summit
this month. However, he said he did not expect any quick
solution to the subsidy problem.
    Clark said Canadian farmers, like those of ASEAN, "are
caught in the cross-fire of an agricultural subsidy war that is
not of our making."
    Clark said his country will provide 10 mln Canadian dlrs as
aid over thu next five years to developing countries of the
South Pacific region to finance fisheries and other marine
projects.
    "The new program, which we estimate will cost about two mln
Canadian dlrs a year, will be implemented by t&#127;e International
Centre for Ocean Development (ICOD) in close cooperation with
the major South Pacific regional organisations," he said.

<TITLE>VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was
carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said
the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South
Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
stocks.
    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
depended on the quality of the concentrates.
    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies
there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being
held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and
Smelting Ltd.

declined to comment on market rumours that it may be
considering a bid for the U.S. Health care group The Gillette
Co &lt;GS.N>.
    Gillette shares are traded on the over-the-counter market
in London and this morning stood one dollar higher at 38 dlrs
in response to the bid speculation. Unilever dipped 33p to
3,275 in a generally depressed U.K. Market.
    Most analysts dismissed the rumours saying it was an old
story, and one commented that it was "utter rubbish," adding he
thought Unilever would not be interested in Gillette.
    Gillette shares rose sharply at the beginning of the month
on Wall Street rumours that Sir James Goldsmith was building a
stake in the company.
    Gillette has been the subject of repeated rumours since
Ronald Perelman, chairman of the Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>, made
an unsuccessful bid for the company last year.

<TITLE>PEFCO SELLS NOTES VIA J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Private Export Funding Corp, PEFCO, is
offering 150 mln dlrs of secured notes due 1994 with an 8.60
pct coupon and par pricing, said J.P. Morgan Securities Inc,
acting as lead manager of its first corporate debt deal.
    "To our knowledge, this is the first time that an affiliate
of a bank holding company has been a manager of a corporate
bond offering in the U.S.," a spokesman for J.P. Morgan and Co
Inc said.
    J.P. Morgan Securities is an affiliate of J.P. Morgan and
Co, the fifth largest bank in the U.S.
    The J.P. Morgan spokesman explained that because the PEFCO
notes are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the securities
affiliate was not prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act from
underwriting the issue.
    Indeed, Bankers Trust Co and Citicorp Investment Bank,
which are affiliates of Bankers Trust New York Corp and
Citicorp respectively, were co-managers of the PEFCO offering.
    Passed by Congress in 1933, Glass-Steagall bars commercial
banks from owning brokerage firms and engaging in such
investment banking activities as underwriting corporate
securities or municipal revenue bonds.
    Last year, several major U.S. banks formed investment
banking affiliates and applied to the Federal Reserve Board for
authorization to offer commercial paper and underwrite and
trade municipal revenue bonds and some forms of mortgage-backed
securities.
    J.P. Morgan Securities received permission from the Fed
several weeks ago for these activities, the spokesman said.
    But the Securities Industry Association, a trade group of
investment banking firms, appealed the decision. J.P. Morgan
also appealed because it believed the Fed placed too many
restrictions on the bank's affiliate, the spokesman said.
    "The Securities and Exchange Commission got a stay, so we
are not engaging in those activities," the J.P. Morgan
spokesman said.
    "We are perfectly eligable to underwrite this offering. We
are endeavoring to prove that there is nothing mysterious about
this business," the spokesman said.
    He added, "Ruling off certain markets does not serve the
public policy.
    J.P. Morgan Securities was formed in April 1986 with
capitalization of 250 mln dlrs, the spokesman said. At year-end
1986, the firm had 261.5 mln dlrs of capital.
    Dillon, Read and Co Inc, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and
Salomon Brothers Inc also served as co-managers of the PEFCO
deal.
    The issue's yield was 50 basis points over comparable
Treasury securities. The notes are non-callable for life. A
top-flight AAA rating by Moody's and Standard and Poor's is
anticipated.
    The gross spread is 5.75 dlrs, the selling concession is
3.50 dlrs and the reallowance is two dlrs.
    The spokesman said J.P. Morgan Securities was a member of
an underwriting syndicate for a Sallie Mae issue last year.

<TITLE>BRITISH TELECOM LOOKS FORWARD TO MORE PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>
said it looked to further progress this year after reporting a
11.7 pct rise in 1986/87 pretax profits to 2.07 billion stg.
    The result was at the top end of market expectations but
the shares nonetheless declined from last night's closing
levels to stand 12p lower at 303p at 1130 GMT.
    Telephone call income rose 9.5 pct to 4.97 billion while
rental income increased 10.6 pct to 3.06 billion.
    The company said it had not paid anything through its
profit-sharing scheme, after 18 mln stg last year, considering
such payments inappropriate after a series of strikes.

    It said total operating costs rose 806 mln stg to 7.08
billion while its basket of across-the-range tariffs had been
reduced overall by 0.3 pct last November under arrangements set
up before privatisation.
    Despite the rise in profits, taxation rose only 11 mln stg
to 754 mln, reflecting the cut in U.K. Corporation tax to 35
pct from 40 pct during the year. Gearing fell to 33 pct from 39
pct. Price regulation formulae were introduced for both the
previously state-owned utilities that have been floated off.
Yesterday, British Gas Plc &lt;BRGS.L> said it was cutting tariffs
for domestic customers by about 4.5 pct.
    BT chairman Sir George Jefferson said work on new digital
exchanges and optical fibre links will continue and the fight
against vandalism of public call boxes would go on.
    "We have been spending 160 mln stg over three years
modernising and expanding our payphone service to make our call
boxes more reliable and harder to vandalise."
    Expenditure on digital exchanges was about 500 mln stg and
progress had been made in installing optical fibre.

<TITLE>U.S. BUDGET COMPROMISE REACHED IN CONGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional Democratic leaders
announced a compromise has been reached on a 1988 budget,
paving the way for final approval of a trillion dollar spending
plan.
    House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd told a news conference that final congressional approval
of the plan to reduce an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit next
year to 134 billion dlr was expected next week.
    The plan was worked out by Democrats who control both House
and Senate but who have been stalemated for a month over
different House and Senate budgets that passed earlier.
    The budget proposes 19.5 billion dlrs in new taxes next
year, 65 billion dlrs over a three year span.
    It would cut President Reagan's request to spend 298
billion dlrs for defense in 1988 by about nine billion dlrs,
but only if he accepts the proposed tax increase to pay for it.
    If Reagan rejects the tax rise, which he has said he would,
defense spending under the plan would drop automatically by
about five billion dlrs, the leaders said.
    Reagan's own budget was rejected by wide margins in both
House and Senate by a combination of Democrats and his own
Republican party who said it was unrealistic.

<DATELINE>    Washington, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senator Kent Conrad, D-ND, said
President Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by
the year 2000 is doomed to failure because the European
Community, EC, will not accept it.
    "It (Reagan plan) is a nonstarter. Its absolutely crystal
clear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies,"
said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe.
    Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said the
U.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy,
CAP, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement with
Brussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-price
system of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan,
export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps,
said Conrad, a new member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.

12 mln dlrs to its reserves for losses on international loans,
causing a second quarter loss of about nine mln dlrs.
    The company said it expects a profit for the calendar year
that will be more than sufficient to cover dividend payments,
and the current dividend policy will be maintained.  The
company now pays seven cts per share quarterly.
    Washington Bancorp earned 2,358,000 dlrs for last year's

<TITLE>RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>European coffee traders and roasters
may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
    "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.
    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
re-introducing quotas.
    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
countries.
    The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
close, and problems with some Government officials.
    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
    "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
end of the week to at least present a common European Community
(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.
    "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"
one official said.
    "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
quota allocation is concerned," he added.
    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
    "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
re-introduction, " he said.
    "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader
said.
    "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
meeting in September," the official said.

<TITLE>INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia rejected World Bank
recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank
for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
and the subsidies are a waste of money.
    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
government would continue to maintain production targets for
"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
would save money by importing the commodity.
    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
in the developed nations."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. House and Senate budget
negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
Congressional aides told Reuters.
    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
the budget savings.
    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
savings Glickman claims.
    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
unfair to one commodity.
    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
but not enough, they said.
    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

<TITLE>OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some OPEC states are unhappy about the
prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
about price differentials making some of their crudes
uncompetitive.
    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But
at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well
alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."
    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
marketing incentives have helped their sales.
    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
better priced grades in a "package."
    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
when members offered discounts to attract customers.
    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
analysts say.
    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
pay the new prices.
   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
risen.
    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
differentials question in Vienna.
    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analysts said they were surprised at
the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
statements and positive for the economy.
    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
move lower.
    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
release.
    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
taxation to revenue figures.
    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
tomorrow.
    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
by overseas investors, another said.
    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
market, particularly multi-national companies.
    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
credible.
    "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"
he said.
    An election is due before the end of September.

<TITLE>ACA JOE &lt;ACAJ.O> ACCOUNTANT TO QUALIFY REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aca Joe Inc said Touche Ross and
Co, intends to qualify its report on Aca Joe's year ended
January 31 because of uncertainty about the company's ability
as a going concern.
    The company, which had previously projected "substantial
losses" for fiscal 1987, said it now expects to report a loss
from operations of about five mln dlrs, or 35 cts a share, on
sales of about 23 mln dlrs. For fiscal 1986, Aca Joe reported a
profit of 860,998 dlrs.
    The company also said it is reviewing its alternatives with
its lenders and financial advisers.
    Aca Joe said it and Touche Ross have not yet resolved the
proper accounting treatment of certain assets on the company's
balance sheet.
    As a result of these unresolved issues, the company said,
it has been unable to finalize its audited financial statements
for fiscal 1987 and file its annual report on form 10-K with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Aca Joe said it also
has been unable to comply with the SEC's timely filing
requirements of its 10-Q report for the quarter ended May 2.
   
    Involved in the dispute, Aca Joe said, is the
recoverability of intangible assets totalling about five mln
dlrs arising from the acquisition of Aca Joe Intercon Ltd and
Aca Joe Eastern Ltd, and the recoverability of about one mln
dlrs of ACA JOE trademark rights which were purchased by the
company.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>DUTCH BUTTER CONSUMPTION UP, MARGARINE LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch butter consumption rose at the
expense of margarine last year partly because of the European
Community's (EC) cheap butter schemes, the Commodity Board for
Margarine, Fats and Oils (MVO), said.
    Butter consumption rose to 4.1 kilos per head in 1986 from
four kilos in 1985, while margarine consumption including low
fat margarine, fell to 14 kilos per head from 14.3 kilos.
    The low fat margarine figure remained static at 2.6 kilos
per head, while ordinary margarine fell from 11.7 kilos per
head to 11.4 kilos.
    However, cheap butter schemes may not be the only
contributory factor in the changes. The MVO figures show a
fairly steady rise in total butter consumption and fall in
margarine consumption since 1973.
    A graph produced in the MVO annual report shows total Dutch
margarine consumption in 1973 at just under 210,000 tonnes
against around 165,000 in 1986.
    The same graph shows total butter consumption in 1973 at
just over 30,000 tonnes compared with just short of 60,000
tonnes last year.
    However, during the same period total Dutch edible fat and
oil consumption on a fat content basis has risen from around
345,000 tonnes to 360,000 tonnes, or an average of 24.8 kilos
per head in 1986.
    The graph shows that most of the increase has come from
butter and household cooking oil usage.

<TITLE>INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia rejected World Bank
recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank
for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
and the subsidies are a waste of money.
    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
government would continue to maintain production targets for
"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
would save money by importing the commodity.
    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
in the developed nations."

<TITLE>COMPUTER DEPOT &lt;CDPT.O> TO CEASE OPERATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Computer Depot Inc said it
will cease operations and liquidate its assets.
    The decision results from the termination of the company's
line of credit by its asset-based lender and demand by the
lender for immediate payment of all amounts due, it said.
    Computer Depot said it will stop trading in its shares.
Upon liquidation of the company, no accounts are expected to be
available for distribution to shareholders after payments to
creditors, it said.
    In December 1985, Computer Depot, which sold personal
computer systems and software, filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Its plan of
reorganization was approved in December 1986.
    The company said that yesterday, after demand by its
lender, it agreed to voluntarily surrender its inventory,
accounts receivable and other collateral.
    Operations are dependent upon financing and efforts to
obtain financing, including potential buyers and merger
candidates, have been unsuccessful, it said. Computer Depot
said the company will eventually be liquidated.
    Computer Depot reported a loss of 591,000 dlrs for its
second fiscal quarter ended May 2, 1987, after showing a profit
of 237,000 dlrs for its first quarter, which included the
Christmas selling season.
    The company previously reported that sales and margins
after January had been below expectations, due to uncertainty
in the in the retail market following recent product
announcements by International Business Machines &lt;IBM>.
    Computer Depot auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co, qualified
its recent financial statements citing several risks in the 
company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Transmission Co Ltd said it agreed to acquire the Western
Canada oil and gas reserves and properties of AGIP Canada Ltd,
a subsidiary of AGIP SpA, part of Italy's ENI group, for 54 mln
Canadian dlrs.
    At the end of 1986, AGIP Canada reported proven and
probable reserves of 4.2 mln barrels of crude oil and natural
gas liquids and 22.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. AGIP
Canada also holds 176,000 net exploratory acres in Western
Canada. Its properties produce about 1,100 barrels of oil a
day.
    The deal is subject to approval by both companies'
directors.
    Westcoast said the acquisition would enable it to apply
more than 150 mln dlrs of accumulated tax pools of AGIP Canada
Ltd to enhance after-tax cash flow from the acquired
properties.
    AGIP Canada said it would retain offshore exploration
blocks in Labrador, a gold mine in Yukon Territory and uranium
interests in Saskatchewan.

it is offering 2,513,200 common shares at a price of 20.625

is talking with a possible fourth bidder for the company.
    The company also said Lynch Corp &lt;LGL> has renewed its
offer for Becor which was withdrawn last week.
    Talks with the possible bidder are expected to be concluded
shortly, Becor said, adding its board will evaluate all then
existing offers at that time.
    In the meantime, the company said, it plans today to
adjourn further its meeting of stockholders to June 30. That
meeting was called to act on a merger agreement calling for a
buyout by BCW Acquisitions Inc.
    The third identified Becor suitor is &lt;Davis Mining and
Manufacturing Inc>.
    In Fairfield, N.J., Lynch said its latest proposal calls
Lynch to own 75 pct of Becor's stock and Becor holders to
retain the other 25 pct.
    Peviously, Lynch would have held about 25 pct, with Becor
holders receiving 25 pct and Becor management about half.
    Lynch said the proposal was changed because it believes
Becor's management "needs more guidance in terms of financial
structuring.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. personal income rose 0.2 pct, or
7.9 billion dlrs, in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3,630.0 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    The increase followed a revised 0.4 pct rise in April. The
department previously estimated April income rose 0.3 pct.
    The department also revised up the March personal income
rise to 0.3 pct from a previously reported 0.2 pct.
    Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.1 pct, or 1.5
billion dlrs, to 2,893.3 billion dlrs in May after rising 0.6
pct or 18.6 billion dlrs in April, the department said.
    The department said both the April and May increases in
personal income were restrained by lower subsidy payments to
farmers and by initial payments to a newly established
retirement fund for federal government employees in April.
    Wages and salaries increased 8.8 billion dlrs in May after
a 7.0 billion dlr rise in April, while manufacturing payrolls
were up 1.6 billion dlrs in May after falling 1.3 billion dlrs
in April.
    Farmers' incomes fell 11 billion dlrs in May after
decreasing 6.7 billion dlrs in April due to lower farm subsidy
payments, the department said.

<TITLE>U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
production data showed that the economy is still strong and
does not need a fillip from lower rates.
    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
arguments against easier credit, they said.
    "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
term," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
Rates.
    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
strength.
    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
average earnings in April, dealers said.
    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
the impact on domestic money supply of its current
intervention.
    "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
    "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
good state indeed," Skeoch said.
    "There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
pressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost rises
were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
which were potentially inflationary, he added.
    "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
problem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
about the funding implications of recent intervention.
    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
higher inflation this year.
    "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
long as that continues we're okay," he added.

<TITLE>FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha
Seger said there were signs of helpful stability in foreign
exchange markets in recent weeks.
    "I think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,"
Seger told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions.
    "I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period
of stability," she said.
    She said market forces have a major influence on exchange
rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar
against the Yen or the Mark.
    Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was
concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange
rate influences.
    "I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous," about
exchange rates, Seger said.
    She said the Fed takes into account additional factors in
determining monetary policy than the value of the dollar
against other currencies.
    On the economy, Seger called the latest figures in gross
national product a modest upward revision.

<TITLE>BELL AND HOWELL &lt;BHW> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    chicago, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bell and Howell Co, in remarks prepared
for delivery to the New York Society of Security Analysts, said
it expects per-share earnings to grow in the 12-to-15 pct range
in the next three to four years.
    President Gerald Schultz said the growth is without stock
buybacks and tax law changes. He said the gain is expected off
1986 per-share earnings of 1.89 dlrs, calculated to exclude
DeVry Inc &lt;DVRY.O> operations and non-recurring gains totaling
45 cts a share.
    The company said its decision to sell the DeVry business to
Keller Graduate School of Management Inc will provide Bell and
Howell with a non-recurring gain of more than 4.00 dlrs a share
in the third quarter and about 80 mln dlrs in additional cash.
    "We will use proceeds of the transaction to repurchase
stock (probably at least 10 pct) and for other purposes, such
as reducing debt" Chairman Donald Frey told analysts.
    Bell and Howell said it will invest 16 mln dlrs this year
in electronic product development and introduction.
    It said a stepped-up investment in its IDB2000 electronic
storage system, which uses optical disks, will result in a 5.0
mln dlr loss for the product line, similar to last year. But it
said "the swing to profitability in 1988 for this product will
be significant."
    Currently, Bell and Howell is marketing the IDB2000 only to
General Motors Corp &lt;GM> dealers.

<TITLE>DONORS PLEDGE 3.15 BILLION DLRS INDONESIAN AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a
total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a
statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter
Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.
    This compares with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last
year's meeting, the statement said. It is also well above the
World Bank's recommendation of 2.5 billion guilders in aid for
the coming year.
    "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective
steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," the
statement said.
    The statement said Indonesia must take further steps to set
the stage for resumed economic growth that could create
employment for the country's rapidly growing labour force.
    "These measures include additional significant trade and
industrial deregulation," the statement said.
    It also called for policies supporting efficient and
diversified growth of agriculture, and said Jakarta should give
more room to the private sector. It called on Indonesia to
mobilise more domestic resources to finance development
programs.

<TITLE>N.Y. FED PRESIDENT URGES BANK REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New York Federal Reserve President E.
Gerald Corrigan said he favors bank reform but wants to
maintain the separation of banking and commerce.
    "As I see it, the case for fundamental reform in our banking
and financial system is compelling," Corrigan told the Senate
Banking Committee.
    Corrigan said he believed bank reform should allow banks to
offer a broad range of banking and financial services.
    He said common ownership of banks, thrifts, securities
firms and insurance companies should be allowed but commercial
firms should not own or control insured depositories.
    Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc) said he would
press for bank reform legislation this year and supported
giving banks new power for commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities, municipal bond underwriting and mutual funds.
    Former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston said bank reform
should reflect the reality that other companies were offering
banking services such as checking accounts credit cards and
mortgages.
         
    "The reality is that there is one-stop financial shopping at
banks in some states, but not in others," Wriston said.
    "There is also one-stop financial shopping in all 50 states
at a Sears store or American Express office."
    "We must find ways for banks to deliver new products to new
customers in order to maintain a spread of risk in a business
that is rapidly losing traditional products and customers," he
said.
    But John Weinberg of Goldman, Sachs and Co said allowing
banks to enter the securities business would make banks too
powerful.

directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier in
settlement of its claims for reimbursement of costs it incurred
in connection with a class action and other suits filed against
it from late 1984 through 1986.
    The company said the amount will be recorded as a gain in

being established for continuing legal fees and other expenses
connected with ongoing litigation against its former president.
    The company said it is continuing to pursue the claims
against its former president in connection with events that
required the restatement of results for fiscal 1983 and the
first three quarters of fiscal 1984.
    It also said its largest client, Temple University, has
signed a new contract extending its use of Systems and Computer
as an information provider until June 30, 1992.
    The company said its backlog is now about 77 mln dlrs and
is composed mostly of multiyear facilities management contracts.

<TITLE>ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
estimated.
    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
the unit, leading investors to take profits.
    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
disappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of
days."
    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
to 600 mln dlrs.
    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been
presented to its board.
    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion
dlrs.

<TITLE>CFTC'S DAVIS URGES CAUTION ON OFF-EXCHANGE ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Regulations governing hedging and risk
management should be revised and development of new futures
instruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth of
off-exchange futures instruments, Robert Davis, a commissioner
on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.
    Davis told the Chicago chapter of the Futures Industry
Association Commodity Research Division last night "there is no
cause for undue alarm" in the growth of off-exchange
instruments.
    However, he said, the CFTC "must clarify jurisdictional and
regulatory issues" by maintaining the safeguards intended by
commodity regulations while encouraging "the further
development of competitive markets."
    "There is not a single off-exchange issue, there cannot be
one policy approach, and to the extent that problems exist,
there cannot be one solution," Davis said.
    The development of off-exchange instruments with futures
contract characteristics has become of increasing concern to
federal regulators who are trying to define what issues are
covered under existing regulations and where new regulations
are needed to protect private investment.
    Davis said the CFTC should step up enforcement where
off-exchange instruments are intended to compete with
exchange-traded issues, correct "regulatory inflexibility"
which may force new instruments off exchange, and "delineate
and separate those harmful off-exchange developments from the
many that are not."
    "We cannot ignore that some of the growth of off-exchange
trading represents a desirable further development of financial
forward contracts that complement, rather than compete with,
the relatively new financial futures contracts," Davis said.
    He said a CFTC task force is continuing its investigation
of the off-exchange issue.

begun an offer to exchange on a share-for-share basis shares of
newly authorized Class B common shares for existing common
stock.
    The company said the new Class B will contain limited
dividend rights and have 10 votes rather than one vote per
share for the common stock.
    It also said the new stock will not have a trading market,
will be subject to significant restrictions on its transfer,
will be entitled through 1989 to no more than 80 pct of the
cash dividends on the common stock and will be convertible into
common stock at any time.
    The company said it does not recommend that shareholdrs
other than chairman and chief executive William Olsten and his
family tender their common for exchange.
    The offer will expire July 16.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> LAYING OFF 850 WORKERS AT TWO PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp said it will
permanently lay off 850 hourly workers in August at its car
assembly plants in Janesville, Wisc, and Lordstown, Ohio, due
to production cutbacks in the slow-selling cars built at both
facilities.
    GM, the largest U.S. automaker but suffering from lower
sales for months, said 350 of the 3,800 workers at the
Janesville plant would be put on indefinite layoff effective
August 11 as the production rate for 1988-model Cadillac
Cimarrons and Chevrolet Cavalier compact cars is reduced by
five units per hour.
    Another 500 workers of the 5,100 employed at GM's
Lordstown, Ohio, plant will be laid off effective August 24,
the company said.
    GM said it will begin that date its production of
1988-model Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbirds on two
shifts with a cut of six units an hour from the current rate.
   GM also said it will change its method for reporting
indefinite layoffs to monthly releases from the previous weekly
system "to achieve more complete, accurate and less-confusing
reporting of production-schedule adjustments."

<TITLE>DUTCH CONSUMERS/INDUSTRY SEE VEG OILS TAX THREAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch consumers and food processors
would be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick
de Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats
and oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.
    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and
fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.
    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and
steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato
processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.
    "A move by these industries to countries outside the EC
cannot be ruled out," he added.
    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats
would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely
expensive administratively.
    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article
three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the
Lome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.
    The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also
have consequences for employment and investment, he added.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>French media and publishing group Hachette
&lt;HACP.PA> expects a record 15 pct rise in its profits this
year, Hachette chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere said.
    Lagardere told a news conference that Hachette's profits
last year were 565.4 mln francs against 431.7 mln in 1985.

    He said that Hachette was carrying out feasibility studies
for the launching around October next year of a nationwide
daily newspaper. Earlier this year it made an unsuccessful
three billion franc bid for state-owned television network
TF-1.
    In a letter sent to shareholders, Lagardere said that 1987
was likely to be another record year for the company.
    Hachette owns the Europe-1 radio station, about 60 weekly
newspapers and magazines, and is also involved in printing.
    It posted a 14.7 billion franc consolidated turnover last
year against 11.6 billion in 1985.

<TITLE>GLOBAL YIELD FUND &lt;PGY> REVIEWS DIVIDEND POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Global Yield Fund, in a review of its
dividend policy, told shareholders that under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, the fund must distribute substantially
all of its net income by the end of each year.
    Under the new tax law, the company said annual net income
includes net investment income from interest less expenses, plu
or minus any ordinary currency gains or losses realized in
connection with the sale of debt securities.
   
    The company said its present dividend policy is to make
distributions of net investment income to stockholders
quarterly and to accumulate any realized ordinary currency
gains for distribution as net income at the end of the year.
    At present time, the company said such currency gains
amount to about 40 cts per share.
    However, any currency net loss realized during the
remaining six and a half month period between now and the end
of the year could not only reduce or eliminate distributions
from this source but could reduce distributions from net
investment income, the company said.
   
    According to Global, the board would determine on an annual
basis whether to distribute or retain net long-term realized
capital gains.
    In other matters, the company said its shareholders at its
first annual meeting elected nine directors, approved the
investment management agreement with &lt;Prudential Insurance Co
of America>, and the service agreement between Prudential and
the &lt;Prudential Investment Corp>.
   
    Shareholders also approved the administration agreement
with &lt;Prudential-Bache Securities Inc> and amended the fund's
investment restrictions to permit the purchase of portfolio
securities while borrowings are outstanding, the company said.

<TITLE>U.S. SAYS IT WON'T YIELD IN JOURNALIST'S KIDNAPPING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18- </DATELINE><BODY>The United States, responding to the
kidnapping of American journalist Charles Glass, today insisted
it would not yield to terrorist blackmail.
    "While much remains unclear, we assume this is another
terrorist attempt to manipulate the United States through our
concern for our citizens," the State Department said in a
statement.
    "While we are deeply concerned for the well-being of Mr.
Glass, Mr. (Ali) Usayran and all hostages, American and
foreign, and extend our sympathy to their families and friends,
we repeat that we will not yield to terrorist blackmail," it
said.
    The State Department said its embassy in Beirut had learned
that Glass, a journalist on leave from his job with ABC
television, and Usayran, the son of the Lebanese defense
minister, were kidnapped on the Awaz'i Road in the southern
suburbs of Beirut north of Beirut International Airport on June
17.
    "We know of no claims of responsibility," the department
said.
    "We hold the kidnappers responsible for the safety of their
victims and call for the immediate and unconditional release of
all those held hostages," it added.

<TITLE>SYKES DATATRONICS &lt;SYKE.O> SELLS DEBENTURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sykes Datatronics Inc said it
has agreed in principle for Marshall Associates and H and M
resources Inc to each purchase up to one mln dlrs of its
convertible debentures, allowing Sykes to pay in full its debt
to Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL>.
    The company said at closing, each investor will buy 750,000
dlrs of convertible debentures bearing interest at three points
over the prime rate.  It said interest only is payable until
June 1, 1990, when repayment of principal in 20 quarterly
installments.
    Sykes said the remaining 250,000 dlrs of each commitment
may be drawn down at Sykes' option after December 1, 1987 if
the company has met certain performance levels.
    It said the debentures are convertible into common stock at
15 cts per share.  It said if it has now drawn all of the
remaining 500,000 dlrs of debentures, the investor can buy
whatever amount of debentures remain unsold and immediately
convert  them to Sykes stock.
    Sykes said if both investors were to convert all of the
debentures, they would own 13.3 mln Sykes shares.  Sykes now
has 13.0 mln shares outstanding.
    Sykes said, however, that the agreement with the investors
provides that the number of shares resulting from the
conversion of the debentures may not be in an amount that would
limit Sykes' ability to use its net operating loss carryforward
under the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  The provisioin would
prevcent the investor from owning more than 50 pct of Sykes'
shares immediately after conversion, it said.
    The company said closing of the trasaction is expected
before July 1, subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion
from an investment banker, Moseley Holdings Corp &lt;MOSE.O>.
    Sykes said it will use 1,100,000 dlrs of the initial
1,500,000 dlrs in proceeds, together with a 200,000 dlr note,
to pay in full all its debt to Chase and Chemical.  The banks
will then release their security interests in sykes assets,
which will be pledged to the two new investors instead, it
said.
    Sykes said on payment to the banks, it will no longer have
to pay to the banks lease payments and proceeds from the sale
of excess inventory and assets.

A-2 from A-1 the commercial paper of Tektronix Inc.
    S and P cited the management's plan to repurchase up to 380
mln dlrs of common equity. The plan will greatly reduce
liquidity and raise debt to total capital by increasing
Tektronix's sensitivity to industry volatility. Because weak
primary markets have led to slow growth in recent years, a
strong balance sheet has been a major support for credit
quality, the agency noted.
    It added that the firm may improve long-term growth, but
increased competition may inhibit a return to previous levels.

<TITLE>BONN SHOULD SPEED UP TAX REFORM, INSTITUTE SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's proposed tax reform should
be brought forward to stimulate economic growth and head off
U.S.-led pressure on Bonn to take further fiscal steps to help
boost the world economy, the Ifo economic institute said.
    An Ifo report said, "The total growth effect of the reform
could be considerably enhanced, and international pressure on
the government therefore reduced, if a larger portion of the
tax cuts planned by 1990 were brought forward to 1988."
    Swift action is required to remove growing doubts about how
the 44 billion mark tax reform will be financed, Ifo said.
    The report says the tax reform will be insufficient and too
late to stimulate economic growth, as demanded by West
Germany's industrial partners.
    Since the lion's share of cuts worth a gross 44 billion
marks "will not go into effect before 1990, their impact on
growth will be too little, too late," said Ifo.
    The West German government has consistently said that by
cutting taxes and encouraging consumer spending it is boosting
domestic demand and making a significant contribution to world
economic growth.
    Bonn has agreed to increase the scope of tax reductions
planned for 1988. In March, the government said 1988 tax cuts
would be expanded by 5.2 billion marks to 13.7 billion.
    A month later, economics minister Martin Bangemann
countered a joint call from all five German economic institutes
to speed up tax cuts by saying such a step would endanger
efforts to consolidate the budget and keep new public borrowing
down.
    Financing the tax reform has become an "acute problem," Ifo
said.
    "Currently, every proposal over financing (the reform) comes
up against political opposition. There will be a lot more
criticism before the outstanding 19.4 billion marks needed to
finance the reform has been accounted for," the report said.
    The government has pledged to agree by the Autumn how to
raise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance tax cuts.
Subsidies paid to ailing industries are the major target.
    But even leading coalition members like Matthias Wissmann,
economics spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic party,
have conceded that subsidy cuts exceeding five billion marks
are unrealistic, leaving a remaining 14 billion marks to be
found.
    An increase in public borrowing will be inevitable to help
finance the tax cuts, but Bonn should be able to cope with
this, the report said.
    Despite vigorous opposition from the Free Democrats, the
junior partners in the centre-right coalition government, Bonn
will eventually be forced to increase value added tax (VAT) due
to tax harmonisation measures within the European Community. A
VAT increase will also provide funds for income tax reform, the
report said.
    Viewed in the context of efforts by Bonn, Washington and
Tokyo to reform taxes, "despite its various shortcomings, West
Germany's planned tax reform is better than its reputation," Ifo
said.
    The effective cut in the income tax burden carried by West
Germans will be greater than in the U.S., Although the rate
reductions are smaller and income tax levels will remain higher
overall, the report said.

<TITLE>BOARD REJECTS HYDRO-QUEBEC SALES TO NEW ENGLAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's National Energy Board has
denied an application by Quebec-owned Hydro-Quebec to export
about three billion Canadian dlrs worth of electricity to the
New England states, a board spokeswoman told Reuters.
    The decision is to be made public later today, chief
information officer Ann Sicotte said.
    Sicotte said the board rejected tha application after four
months of hearings because Hydro-Quebec did not offer the
electricity first to Canadian provinces and could not prove it
was surplus to Canadian needs.
    Sicotte said Hydro-Quebec can apply for a review of the
decision if there are new facts or changed circumstances, and
could also launch an appeal with the federal court or file a
new application.
    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said the utility had
not yet been officially notified and will have to study the
decision before deciding what action to take.
    The contract was a 10-year agreement with power exports
beginning in 1990. "They weren't able to demonstrate that the
electricity was surplus and one way to demonstrate that is by
offering it to neighboring provinces," Sicotte said.
    Hebert said the utility argued that it can generate  enough
electricity to supply its U.S. and Canadian customers.
    "Our position is that electricity is a manufactured
product--so everyboday can manufacture it and anybody can buy
some--if they (the provinces) want to buy some from us, we're
willing to discuss it," he said.
    The application is the first the National Energy Board has
rejected outright, Sicotte said.
    New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland had
opposed the contract at Energy Board hearings this spring.

total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a
statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter
Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.
    The funds compare with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last

the coming year, the statement said.
    "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective
steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," it said.
    The statement said Indonesia must take further steps toward
economic growth to create employment and called for policies
supporting growth of agriculture.

it has loaned Uganda 92.1 mln dlrs to aid in economic recovery.
    The fund said 60 mln dlrs of the loan is available through
the so-called structural adjustment facility (SAF) over the
next three years.
    The fund said 57.5 mln dlrs will be available immediately
under the SAF and a separate financing arrangement.
    After expanding in the early 1980's, Uganda's economy has
suffered setbacks since 1984 of falling industrial and
agricultural output and accelerating inflation, the fund said.
    The current economic downturn has been worsened by the
sharp decline in the world price of coffee, Uganda's major
export, the fund said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ****ANTWERP, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for the European
Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy
on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help
alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.
    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's
Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils
and Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that the
sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in
the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to
make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem
within that sector by paying a levy."
    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of
budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds
production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.
    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European
Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0
billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"
agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then
feel the full impact of its enlargement.
    The Commission has proposed several cost and production
cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum
guaranteed quantity system, he added.
    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer
prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700
Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe
said.
    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory
amount when market prices are below or above this level.
    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory
amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural
Policy's oils and fats regime.
    "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the
proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete
or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.
    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.
    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied
to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed
it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.
    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do
under present aid arrangements, he said.
    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC
produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities
imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,
Tanghe said.
    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'
requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall
effect would stabilise Community production levels without
affecting demand, he said.
    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current
import levels, he said.
    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are
imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals
requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.
Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported
beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials of Fuerzas Electricas de
Cataluna S.A. (FECSA), the Spanish electricity company, will
hold the first meeting with members of a new debt negotiating
committee representing its creditors in Barcelona on Tuesday,
senior bankers said.
    The talks will cover a possible rescheduling of the
company's 610.57 billion peseta debt, which includes both
foreign and domestic loans and other debt instruments.
    The committee was formed earlier this month after FECSA
agreed to rescind self-imposed terms for its debt repayments,
which were unacceptable to the banks.
    The negotiating committee is a subcommittee of a broader
creditor steering committee made up of some 22 creditor banks
and leasing companies, which is co-chaired by Bank of America
International Ltd and The Sanwa Bank Ltd.
    Bank of America and Sanwa also will co-chair the
negotiating committee. The other members are Bankers Trust Co,
Caixa de Barcelona, Confederacion Espanola de Cajas de Ahorros,
Chase Manhattan Bank, Deutsche Bank, Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan, Orient Leasing Ltd, Crown Leasing Ltd and Japan Overseas
Leasing Co. These banks also are on the broader steering
committee.
    Bankers said that in addition to the negotiating committee,
there also will be a seven-member sub-committee for
documentation and finance of which Citicorp will be chairman.
Gulf Bank KSC will chair a separate committee within the
committee for the documentation.
    The final list of the creditors participating in the
various committees was formulated this morning, and the
steering committee is now notifying FECSA's approximately some
320 creditors of the results.

<TITLE>STEEL FIRMS STUDY USX &lt;X> UNIT PRICE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two major steel companies said they
were studying a price increase announced yesterday by USX
Corp's USS steelmaking division.
    Spokesman for Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>
said the proposed price hike was under study.
    Yesterday, USS said it plans to raise base prices on plate
products by 20 dlrs a ton, or about five pct, effective with
shipments October 4.
    A spokesman for LTV Steel Co, a unit of LTV Corp &lt;QLTV>,
declined comment, adding that the company does not make heavy
plate and makes few other plate products.
    A spokesman for &lt;National Steel Corp>, a joint venture of
National Intergroup Inc &lt;NII> and Nippon Kokan K.K., said the
company is not in the product lines affected.
    Reached later, an Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>
spokesman said the company was studying the pricing move.
    USX said the increase will be on all plate products,
including carbon, high-strength low-alloy, strip mill and alloy
plates. It also said it planned 20-dlr-a-ton increases on some
special plate widths and thicknesses.
    Analysts have said firm prices for steel should contribute
to better results at the nation's major steelmakers.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf Canada Corp shareholders at the
annual meeting approved a previously reported reorganization
plan giving shareholders stock in three publicly traded
companies.
    Shareholders will receive 66 shares in Gulf Canada
Resources Ltd, 29 shares of Abitibi-Price Inc &lt;AIB.TO> and 20
common shares of GW Utilities Ltd for every 100 shares in Gulf
Canada Corp. GW Utilities, a new company, will hold Gulf's 83

Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd and 41 pct of Interprovincial
Pipe Line Ltd &lt;IPL.TO>.

    Debenture holders who objected to the plan withdrew a
proposed amendment when Gulf Canada chairman Marshall Cohen
said they would receive compensation for six months of interest
they would otherwise have lost under the plan.
    The debenture holders had sought to postpone the
reorganization's effective date to July 16 from July 1 in order
to earn interest for the latest six-month period.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THREATENS TO BLOCK EC BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Parliament threatened to
block European Community spending plans for next year and
implied it could also hold up attempts to solve an
ever-deepening budget crisis this year.
    The Parliament voted unanimously in favour of a resolution
condemning the annual haggling and compromising between the
Community's 12 member states on spending levels.
    "It is no longer possible to resort to short-term measures
or to provisional budgetary solutions. It is no longer possible
to accept a budget in which real expenditure is not covered by
revenue," the resolution said.
    Parliamentary blocking could jeopardise efforts to solve a
financing crisis over a five billion European Currency Unit
(ECU) shortfall for this year, diplomats said. EC ministers are
deadlocked on the issue.
    It also would plunge the EC into an ever-deepening crisis
next year. Without parliamentary approval of the 1988 budget,
the Community would be forced into emergency measures, with
spending set according to the previous year's levels.
    British conservative parliamentarian Peter Price told
reporters that parliament could delay an emergency package
until EC ministers prove they are ready to find a long-term
solution.

    Moody's cited Crane's progress in reducing its exposure to
such cyclical industries as steel and in strengthening its core
businesses through acquisitions and cost reduction.
    The agency expects Crane to have further improvement in
operating margins. The diversity of Crane's businesses will
strengthen cash flow and improve debt protection, it said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ogden Corp said it has concluded the
sale outside the United States through &lt;Salomon Bros
International Inc> and &lt;Allen and Co Inc> of 85 mln dlrs of its
six pct convertible subordinated debentures maturing in 2002.
    The company said the debentures are convertible into Ogden
common stock at 79.75 dlrs per share without giving effect to
the 2-for-1 stock split distributable on July three.
    A portion of the proceeds will be used to redeem the 50 mln
dlrs of outstanding senior subordinated debt which currently
bears interest at a rate of about eight pct, the company said.
   
    The balance of the proceeds is expected to be used in the
financing of projects and general corporate purposes, the
company said.
    Ogden also said the potential conversion of the debentures
will not adversely affect its current earnings and cash flow
expectations.
    The debentures have not been, and will not be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or
sold in the U.S. or to a citizen of resident of the U.S., the
company said.

<TITLE>U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal
by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
the Press Association reported.
    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
abandoning a rig.
    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
from corporation tax payable.
    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
said.
    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
shared by the industry as a whole.
    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
built into the accounts, one analyst added.

Commission began proceedings in which it will consider allowing
options trading on exchange-listed securities on more than one
options market.
    In a three-nil decision, the SEC voted to seek public
comment on a proposed rule removing restrictions that prevent
the options from being traded on more than one market.
    Exclusive trading rights in options on exchange-listed
stocks are now determined by a lottery system among options
exchanges.
    The SEC also voted to ask the New York, American, Chicago
Board Options, Pacific and Philadelphia Exchanges to
voluntarily postpone an options allocation lottery scheduled
for June 22 while the matter is under consideration.
    Richard Ketchum, head of the SEC's division of market
regulation, said the exchanges are not required to adhere to
the request.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN DEBT SERVICE RATIO PEAKS, MINISTER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia expects the recent years'
rise in its debt service ratio to peak at the current level of
41 pct, Development Supervision Minister Ali Wardhana told
journalists.
    He was speaking at a news conference following a two day
annual meeting of aid donors grouped in the Inter-Governmental
Group on Indonesia (IGGI) in which 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh
funds were pledged for the coming year.
    "The current debt service ratio of 41 pct will be the top,"
Wardhana said, noting the debt service ratio rose to that level
from 37 pct last year. Indonesia's debt totals 37 billion dlrs.
    "The current debt burden will be manageable if concessionary
loans can be attracted," he said.
    He said international organisations such as the World Bank
pledged an unchanged 1.68 billion dlrs in fresh funds to
Indonesia and this year's overall total, up from last year's
2.6 billion, reflected higher pledges from donor countries.
    He said Japan raised its pledge to 88 billion yen from 80
billion last year. Britain almost trebled its contribution to
130 mln stg from 45 mln. The United States raised its
contribution to 190 mln dlrs from 86 mln and the Netherlands
raised its figure to 232 mln guilders from 180 mln.
    Commenting on the increase in funds pledged to Indonesia,
which has been hard hit in export revenue due to the oil price
collapse, Wardhana said, "I am happily surprised, but in view of
the seriousness of the balance of payments situation the amount
is what we needed to cope."
    He noted donors pledged to increase local cost financing as
part of the aid package. Some 900 mln dlrs of the package will
be for programme aid or local cost financing, Indonesian
Central Bank Governor Arifin Siregar said.
    Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said Indonesia will continue
to reform the economy and bring about further liberalisations.
    "Indonesia has undertaken reforms to meet external problems,"
Saleh said. "It's a good thing and we will continue with
deregulation in trade, industry and licensing of new
businesses."
    Asked whether the question of private capital exports from
Indonesia was discussed, central bank governor Arifin Siregar
expressed confidence that any drain of capital abroad would
only be temporary.
    He noted there had been a turnaround in a recent fall in
foreign exchange reserves three days ago.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANTWERP, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rate of increase in world palm oil
use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000
tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,
editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in
the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to
8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average
increase of 550,000 tonnes.
     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected
to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier
levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.
    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes
above this season's available amount, Mielke said.
    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will
slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area
expansion in Indonesia, he said.
    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian
mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and
at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.
    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,
where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,
but where yields are lower, he said.
     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also
expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,
cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and
palm.
    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were
unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current
season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago
and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.
    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start
of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by
the end of next season.
    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last
October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at
the end of next season, Mielke said.
    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the
course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in
soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln
tonnes or by one fifth.
    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,
for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln
tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks
of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this
season.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Duff and Phelps said it lowered its
ratings on outstanding notes and debentures of Transco Energy
Company and its subsidiary Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Company, affecting 887 mln dlrs in debt securities.
    Transco Energy cumulative convertible preferred stock was
lowered to DP-12 (middle BB) from DP-10 (low BBB) and
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line notes and debentures were
lowered to DP-10 from DP-8 (high BBB) and preferred stock to
DP-11 (high BB) from DP-9 (middle BBB).
    Duff and Phelps said the downgrade reflects an increase in
Transco's estimate of payments it will require to settle
take-or-pay liabilities from 550 mln dlrs to 900 mln dlrs.
Transco has already made more than 400 mln dlrs in cash
payments.
    In addition, natural gas remains in excess supply and the
ability of Transcontinental to keep its pipeline full is
subject to increaseing competition.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS WORRIED BY FAILURE OF EC TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's leading farmer's union, the
FNSEA, said it is worried that negotiations on the 1987/88 farm
price package will now be tackled by European Community leaders
who do not know the agricultural situation.
    The leaders have no specialised knowledge of the farm
dossier and have the tendency to sign compromises which are "too
broad," union leader Raymond Lacombe said. But he added French
Farm Minister Francois Guillaume had reason to reject a
compromise which would have been negative for the farm sector.
    EC ministers ended talks this morning having failed to get
any agreement on agricultural prices for the 1987/88 farm year,
which started on April 1 for certain products.
    Lacombe said the French government should guarantee
farmers' incomes until an agreement is reached.

<TITLE>WOOLWORTH &lt;Z> ANNOUNCES SALES STRATEGY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PRINCETON, N.J. - </DATELINE><BODY>FW Woolworth Co's chairman and chief
executive officer, Harold Sells, said the company remains
commmitted to its general merchandise division, despite the
growing importance of its specialty stores.
    The company said its sales in the first quarter ended May 2
were 1.53 billion dlrs, up from 1.41 billion dlrs in the same
period last year.
   
    Sells said the company's specialty stores contributed 65
pct to total operating profit last year, but profits in the
general merchandise sector have been improving. He said the
company has no plans to turn its back on the Woolworth stores.
    "We've spent alot of money on refurbishing and remodeling
our general merchandise stores, and we will continue to do so,"
he said.
    Sells said the number of general merchandise stores is not
increasing. But one of the companies stratagies is to increase
its core departments in the general merchandise stores into
specialty stores, he said.
    He said these include its framescene and cosmetics unit.
    He said the company continues to look at mergers and
acquisitions. But he stressed any acquisitions should make
sense from a strategy standpoint.
    "We're primarily looking for small, emerging growth stores
with a concept that's right to expand on national scale," he
said.
   
   Sells said the company has been looking at a number of
initial experiments on home video sales. He said Woolworth will
become involved this summer with J.C. Penny Co Inc's &lt;JCP>
Tele-Action program, along with a number of other retailers.
    Sells said the Tele-Action program, which is due to go on
air in the Chicago area this summer, will feature products from
Woolworth's Foot Locker unit.

credit and crop insurance, and increased domestic resource
mobilization, the bank said.

including three years of grace, at a variable interest rate -
currently 7.92 pct, the bank said.

<DATELINE>    SPRING VALLEY, N.Y., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Par Pharmaceutical Inc said
it will begin marketing a generic form of Eli Lilly and Co's 
Keflex, a widely used antibiotic whose patent expired April 21,
in about six weeks.
    Generic drugs are cheaper copies of brand name drugs that
have lost their patents.
    Par said its generic form of Keflex, called Cephalexin,
will be made by an overseas supplier so that Par will not have
to make a substantial investment in a separate facility
required to make the product.

<DATELINE>    SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Enzon Inc and Eastman
Kodak Co's Eastman Pharmaceuticals division said the Food and
Drug Administration approved their application to allow
clinical testing of the PEG-uricase drug to proceed.
    Kodak owns 18.7 pct of Enzon and owns the marketing rights
for PEG-uricase and two other drugs Enzon is developing.
    The companies said PEG-uricase is intended to reduce uric
acid levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy and suffering
from gout. A build up of uric acid in the bloodstream, a common
side effect of chemotherapy, often leads to kidney failure.
    Enzon said that under the FDA's new rules to allow patients
with life-threatening diseases to get investigational drugs,
uric acid levels in an extremely ill patient decreased to
normal levels within 48 hours after the drug was injected.
    Separately, it said the FDA granted it permission to
include an unlimited number of patients in trials with PEG-ADA,
a drug used to treat a rare and usually fatal disease in
children called severe combined immuodeficiency.
    It said five children are being treated with the drug and
it hopes to file a new drug application PEG-ADA by late 1987.
When the NDA is approved, the drug can be marketed.

<TITLE>SALOMON INC &lt;SB> SAW REDUCTION IN REVENUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Salomon Inc had a reduction in trading
revenue in April and May, managing director Robert Salomon said
in response to questions.
    Analysts have said they believe the lower second quarter
profit predicted by Salomon Inc was partially the result of
trading losses and lower revenues from low trading volume. They
said they believe the firm, like others on Wall Street,
suffered most from the turbulent weeks for the bond market in
April.
    Robert Salomon would not comment on whether the firm had
actual trading losses, but he said he would not "quarrel" with
a New York Times article that said the firm's losses could have
amounted to 100 mln dlrs.
    "We haven't acknowledged any trading losses other than to
say that April was a difficult month, and you can presume
anything you want from that. we don't have a quarrel with the
new york times article," Salomon said.
     "There cleary was a reduction in the amount of revenues
generated in April and May was a little bit better," he said.
    The New York times attributed the figure to analysts and
unnamed Wall Street officials it said were familiar with the
firm's activities.
    Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund today in a statement
reiterated that the firm expects a profit in the second quarter
but sees lower earnings than last year's second quarter.
Analysts lowered their estimates yesterday to about half of
last year's 75 cts per share.
    "We believe this showing is satisfactory within the
framework of existing market conditions," said Gutfreund in a
statement.

<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, WIS., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Wisconsin Corp said
directors of its First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee
approved a 96 mln dlr increase in the bank's loan loss reserves
in response to uncertainty over the impact of third world debt
repayment problems.
    It said the reserve increase will result in a second
quarter loss to the corporation of an estimated 55 mln dlrs, or
2.80 dlrs a share.
    However, the company said it expects to report a profit for
the year.
    It said its consolidated 1987 earnings are projected to be
between 35 mln dlrs and 45 mln dlrs compared to 55 mln dlrs in
1986.
    It said dividends will not be affected by the increased
loan losses.
    In April, the company placed 59.7 mln dlrs in loans to
Brazil and Ecuador in non-accrual. First Wisconsin also cited
"a growing realization that repayment programs for less
developed countries will continue to be renegotiated into the
foreseeable future." It said its total loan loss reserves now
stand at 160 mln dlrs, or 3.5 pct of all outstanding loans.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) accused the
United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
customs user fee.
    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
improve its balance of payments.
    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
import licensing system. The United States asked for
consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
jargon as "standstill and rollback."
    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oil
imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
procurement list for reasons of national security.
    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
to decide any further action on the charges.
    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
legislation.
    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,
brought the dispute to the GATT last year.

financing program for 1987 and 1988 have reached about 91 pct
of the 1.95 billion dlrs in new loans that banks have been

    This percentage is close to the "critical mass" of
commitments that the International Monetary Fund has requested
as a condition for releasing new loans to the country.
    Senior Citibank executive William Rhodes said he was
encouraged by the banks' response and that telexed commitments
continue to arrive.
    The response of Argentina's 350 foreign bank creditors had
been eagerly awaited because the package is the first to be
marketed since U.S. banks, led by Citibank, decided to take
large second-quarter losses in order to boost their reserves
against existing loans to developing countries.
    Some bankers had feared that banks would refuse to lend new
money so soon after taking a "hit" on the old loans, but
today's news delivers a decisive rebuff to those skeptics.
    The strong response to the package was partly the result of
the inducement of a 3/8 pct early-participation fee for those
banks that agreed to sign up by June 17, bankers said.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Buchizya Mseteka, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping
to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a
year in the next few years despite low world prices,
deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry
officials said.
    But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough
International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has
introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure
the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.
    Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year
ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a
record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.
    "We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial
year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due
to greater availability of spares and equipment," a ZCCM
official said.
    ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another
strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.
    Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes
higher than the previous year and the best production achieved
to date.
    Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper
industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining
is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years
by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of
spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output
last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.
    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984
by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African
Development Bank and the World Bank.
    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and
metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.
    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has
said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as
part of the plan.
    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the
industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under
the five-year restructuring plan.
    Company officials said although reserves were being
depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the
end of the century, though at lower levels of production.
    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for
the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln
kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being
levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.
    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared
with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.
    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in
1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as
the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over
two to the dollar.
    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the
auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,
and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic
strategy based on national resources.
    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the
break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.
    "We are still consulting to see how the new measures will
affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare
under the new situation," Peter Hansen, director of operations
and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.
    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange
rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export
profits.
    "Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even
point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar," Frederick
Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.
    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian
industry.
    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69
cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States
and under 40 cents in Chile.
    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia
being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had
stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.
    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are
sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while
5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.
Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and
fuel.

dockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to

    The Rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues
in Santos, Brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they
would not return to work unless their demands were met.
    Earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a
scheduled national strike to pressure port officials to give
them a wage increase and other benefits.
    A Rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses
of about 100,000 U.S. dlrs.

<TITLE>TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES,TAXES IN 1987/8 BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tanzanian government, in its
second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery
program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced
increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on
government services.
    Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected
to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,
39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide
48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to
be financed through domestic and foreign loans.
    This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only
3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to
impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No
figure for the final deficit was avaialble.
    The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with
effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30
pct.
    Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar
increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would
rise by 75 pct.
    The higher levies affect official transactions such as road
tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK MISSION HOLDS LOAN TALKS WITH BRAZIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A World Bank mission today held talks
with a senior Finance Ministry official to discuss Brazil's
requests for loans, ministry officials said.
    They said Brazil, the bank's biggest customer, was asking
for two billion dlrs for the financial year starting in July,
including 500 mln dlrs for the energy sector.
    The mission, headed by Gabin Ran Kankani, head of the
Bank's Brazil division, met Finance Ministry secretary Nailson
Nobrega.
    Officials said they had provided the World Bank with
information on the economic plan now being drawn up by Finance
Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira.
    The government has invited the IMF to come to study the
plan next Monday.
    Bresser Pereira will use the plan as the basis for
negotiations with creditors next month in an attempt to
reschedule the country's 111 billion dollar debt.

    Earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a

<TITLE>FTC CHARGES KRAFT &lt;KRA> WITH FALSE ADVERTISING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Trade Commission charged
Kraft Inc with false and misleading advertising by overstating
the calcuim content of its Kraft Singles cheese product.
    In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged the
Glenview, Ill., food and consumer products company with
claiming that a slice of Kraft Singles American Pasteurized
Process Cheese Food (Kraft Singles) contains the same amount of
calcium as five ounces of milk, when it does not.
    The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singles
contained more calcium than do most imitation cheese slices,
the FTC charged.
    The FTC complaint also charged that Kraft said it could
substantiate these claims when, in fact, it could not.
    "Nutritional information is important to consumers, but it
can be difficult for them to verify." FTC Bureau of Consumer
Protection Director William MacLeod said in a statement. "That
is why we seek to maintain the accuracy of nutritional claims."
    The FTC, which voted 4-1 in favor of issuing the complaint,
generally takes such action when it has reason to believe that
the law has been or is being violated and where it apears to
the commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.
    The filing of an administrative complaint marks the
beginning of a proceeding that often takes up to a year in
which the allegations will be ruled upon after a formal
hearing.
    If the commission's allegations are upheld, Kraft could be
prohibited from misrepresenting the calcium or other nutrient
content of its cheese-type products, including those made in
comparative ads.
    The company could also be prohibited from making such
claims without having competent and reliable scientific
evidence.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID UNFAIRLY PROTECTING DEFENSE INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's Defence Minister George Younger
said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and
this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.
    Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.
Legislators were failing to realise "the true nature of the
two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.
    A British parliamentary report said that up to March
British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of
contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with
the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.
    The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and
"selectiveness" towards foreign contractors had denied British
competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them
from technological research for SDI.
    Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts
under conditions of fair and open competition. "All we ask is
for our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added.
    If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair
subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be
surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,
Younger said.

<TITLE>WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West Texas cotton crop was largely
unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
said.
    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension
agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
Texas.
    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
cents.
    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a
senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane
force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.
    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
worse," Mohler said.
    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE RAPS DEMOCRATS' BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House called a compromise
budget hammered out by congressional Democratic leaders a
"pickpocket" spending plan, but barred negotiations on changing
it until budget reforms are in place.
    Noting that the trillion dollar budget would raise taxes by
65 billion dlrs over the next three years while scaling back
President Reagan's military spending proposals, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, "The president isn't buying it and
neither will the American people.
    "The Democrats refer to tax increases as deficit reduction
-- a pickpocket way to lift your wallet to pay for your dinner,"
Fitzwater said.
    The White House official, in an apparent retreat from an
earlier administration stance, also said negotiations on a
budget acceptable to Reagan and the Democratic-led Congress
could not begin until budget reforms are adopted.
    The White House has previously said it would not negotiate
on a budget until the congressional Democrats were able to
agree among themselves. Democratic leaders have called for a
"summit" conference with the White House on the budget.
    "If we had a budget reform package that ensured a sound,
enforceable negotiating process, we would be interested in
pursuing it, Fitzwater said.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgium is to start negotiations with
three consortia on sharing out a major order for modernising
the country's telecommunications network, a government
spokesman said.
    The three consortia are Bell Telephone Manufacturing Co NV,
a subsidiary of ITT Corp &lt;ITT>, together with Acec SA
&lt;ACEC.BR>; Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> and ATEA SA, a subsidiary of GTE
Corp &lt;GTE>; and NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS> with
American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T>.

    The deal is estimated to be worth around 50 billion francs,
although a government spokeswoman declined to confirm this. The
order covers new telephone exchanges, cables and terminals.
    The go-ahead for the talks followed an outline agreement
within the centre-right government coalition today. The accord
came after months of discussions that have been complicated by
demands for the order to be shared out fairly between the
French and Dutch speaking parts of Belgium.
    Government officials declined to give details of the
outline agreement or how the order will be divided between the
three consortia.

Pakistan 220 mln dlrs in three loans to support projects in
education, energy conservation and modernization, and
small-scale industry development.
    The education project will be supported by a 145 mln dlr
loan through the International Development Association, the
bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the bank said.
    The bank noted Pakistan's low educational attainment,
particularly among women, is an obstacle to the country's
development.
    It said the education project aims to increase literacy and
school enrollment rates through curriculum reform, teacher
training, parental participation and school construction.
    A small-scale industry development project will be
supported by a 54 mln dlr loan, the bank said.
    The project hopes to aid small-scale industry by
encouraging bank lending, developing export markets, and
supporting technology transfer, the bank said.
    The third project, to improve refinery efficiency, reduce
energy consumption and increase crude oil processing capacity,
will be supported by a 21 mln dlr loan.

<TITLE>S. AFRICAN UNION OBJECTS TO PLANNED MATTHEY MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A South African trade union is in
dispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over
the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near
Johannesburg to a black tribal homeland.
    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial
Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana
homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could
lead to job losses and affect wages.
    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd &lt;IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum
prices rocketing.

    The union said talks with management over the proposed move
had broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers
showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that
no final decision had been taken on strike action.
    The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg
Platinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.
    It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary
of Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by
mining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd.

<TITLE>GULF CANADA &lt;GOC> IN DEAL WITH BONDHOLDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A compromise reached between Gulf Canada
Corp and debenture holders at the annual meeting today will
cost the company or its major shareholder "a couple of million"
dollars, chairman Marshall Cohen said.
    After about a half-hour discussion with debenture holders
during the meeting, Cohen and Gulf lawyers agreed to compensate
them for about six months of interest that they would have lost
under a corporate reorganization plan taking effect July one.
The holders then withdrew a proposed amendment that sought to
delay the plan's closing to July 16 so they could collect
interest due to be paid July 15.
    "We have not sorted out the mechanics of how we're going to
do this," Cohen told reporters later.
    "It may well be that in the end the principal shareholder
may absorb that interest," he said, referring to the Reichmann
family's Olympia and York Developments Ltd, which owns about 79
pct of Gulf Canada.                                     Cohen
said he wanted to ensure that Gulf Canada need not revise
reorganization proposals already on file with Revenue Canada
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    "If Gulf can't pay it (the interest) without upsetting the
applecart, Olympia and York will pay," he said.
    The reorganization will see Gulf Canada Corp renamed Gulf
Canada Resources Ltd. Shareholders will be offered shares of
three separate publicly traded companies, Gulf Canada
Resources, Abitibi-Price Inc &lt;A.TO> and GW Utilities Ltd.
    Newly formed GW Utilities will hold Gulf Canada's interests
in Consumers' Gas Co Ltd &lt;CGT.TO>, Hiram Walker-Gooderham and
Worts Ltd and Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd &lt;IPL.TO>.
    Cohen said Olympia and York's interest in Gulf Canada
Resources will slip to about 68 or 69 pct as a result of a
previously announced plan to sell 450 mln dlrs of new stock.
                             
    In answer to a reporter's question, Cohen said there was a
possibility that the size of the offering could be increased.
    "There seems to be pretty strong interest," he said, but he
added that much depended upon market conditions at the time of
pricing. The issue will be priced later this month, according
to a company official.

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Court of Cyprus has rejected
a plea by an offshore securities trading company against a
Central Bank decision to revoke its licence.
    Central Bank officer Eleftherios Ioannou told Reuters that
the court had dismissed the appeal by York International

    The Bank in February withdrew York's licence and froze its

<TITLE>BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A trade-led boom in the U.S. is
unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its
latest economic report.
    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,
after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.
    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,
the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.
    "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop
dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
a falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.
    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
    The report was released before the Commerce Department
reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
    "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.
    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
improvement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes on
the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," he
added.

<TITLE>BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By NAILENE CHOU WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to
transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
    Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
analysts said.
    Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing
pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
Brooklyn Union official said.
    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
to rate payers.
    While net effect on the company will not be known for
several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
will end up paying more for gas, he said.
    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette, said.
    If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,
Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost
factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
firm, said.
    "But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers," he said.
    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
alternative fuels, he said.
    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
on the inventory charge, he said.
    "Cool heads will prevail," DLJ's Launer said, " but it may
take a while."

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
upgraded Ohio Edison Co's 2.7 billion dlrs of debt securities.
    Raised to Baa-2 from Baa-3 were the utility's first
mortgage bonds, preferred stock and secured pollution control
issues, and the guaranteed Euronotes of Ohio Edison Finance NV.
Moody's upgraded Ohio Edison's unsecured issues and preference
stock to Baa-3 from Ba-1.
    The likely approval of a 152 mln dlr, or 10 pct, rate hike
by Ohio Public Utilities Commission significantly reduces a key
component of financial risk. It would be implemented on Perry
Unit One's expected Fall in-service date, Moody's said.

to restart the last idle potuction line at its Troutdale, Ore.,
primary aluminum plant.
    With the restart of this 22,700-metric-tonne-per-year line,
Reynolds said, it will be operating at 100 pct of its
consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per
year.
    Reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart in
the near future and it is expected that actual metal production
will begin on September one.
    The company said the start up was necessitated by
continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide
inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds'
various fabricating businesses.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GLAXO &lt;GLX> STOCK OFF ON ULCER REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Glaxo Holdings PLC fell
following a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine
that antibiotics may be able to treat ulcers, threatening 
Glaxo's billion dlr antiulcer drug Zantac, analysts said.
    Glaxo's was trading at 27-7/8, off 1/2, on volume of
1,786,800 shares. Shares of SmithKline Beckman &lt;SKB>, maker of
the popular anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also fell 7/8 to 60-1/4.
    "Anything that raises the possiblity of an entirely new
therapy for ulcers would attack the core of Glaxo's worldwide
business, which is Zantac," said David MacCallum, an analyst
who follows Glaxo for Hambrecht and Quist.
   
    Zantac is the world's most prescribed drug with annual
sales of over one billion dollars, accounting for almost 75 pct
of Glaxo's earnings, said MacCallum.
    "If there is any perception that Zantac is not the therapy
of choice for ulcers, Glaxo's sales and profits could decline,"
said Tina Rizopuolos, an analyst with Alexanders Laing and
Or'kshnk.
    Rizopuolos said the New England Journal article, led by a
University of Toronto researcher, concludes from a study of 71
children with gastric disease that bacteria could cause
gastritis and ulcers.
   
    In an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal,
Richard Hornick of the University of Rochester School of
Medicine, reviewed studies using antibiotics to treat ulcers.
Rizopuolos said Hornick concludes that the bacteria ulcer
relationship is "exciting and intriguing," but further studies
are needed to show a direct causal effect.
    Ulcers happen when the stomach's protective lining erodes
and is exposed to underlying inflamed tissue, but it is unknown
what actually causes the process.
   
It is known that stomach acids exacerbate ulcers and therefore
antacids were commonly used to alleviate ulcers before Tagamet
and Zantac came along. Both of these drugs prevent the release
of the hormone histamine in the stomach, which triggers acid
secretion.
    "I don't think people should run out and sell Glaxo," said
analyst Rizopuolos. "It will take a long time to displace
Tagamet and Zantac...those drugs are going to be prescribed by
physicians for a long time," she added.

<TITLE>ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Tin Council, ITC,
intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the
presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.
    The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the
London Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in
1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which
the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer
stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.
    The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn
Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next
week. Court does not sit tomorrow.
    In essence the Council is claiming that its status is
similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can
therefore not be used in an English court of law.
    The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of
schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow
when the European Community's legal advisers were due to
attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various
legal actions today.
    Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal
administrative matters, delegates said.
    The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after
June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth
International Tin Agreement.
    As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council
will continue with its statistical work and carry out some
research studies, although staffing in the research department
is being cut to one from two previously.
    At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes
of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members
and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the
consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions
are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.

<TITLE>GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
Co that could draw some big international players and in the
process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
said.
    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
to make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to
describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
takeover target.
    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
three yesterday.
    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
returned telephone calls seeking comment.
    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
someone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj of
Merrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen
but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
dlrs per share."
    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
operations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
the dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon
has recently made two other acquisitions.
    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,
RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston
Purina Co &lt;RAL>.
    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a
Wall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the
company is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
to resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board
consenting, what has changed between November and now," he
said.
   
    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
calculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has to
be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
shareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
adviser.

renovations and energy conservation, the bank said.
    It said the project also seeks to reduce agricultural
nutrient imbalances by building the capacity for phosphate
fertilizer production and to improve institutional efficiency
by introducing modern economic, financial and operational

<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>PNC Financial Corp said it will raise
its loan loss reserve by 110 mln dlrs to about 386 mln dlrs,
reducing second quarter results by 66 mln dlrs or 92 cts per
share on a fully diluted basis.
    The company said that after the charge it still expects to
report a second quarter profit and expects a first half profit
of about 100 mln dlrs.
    It added that it expects normal operating earnings in the
second half.
    The company earned 68.5 mln dlrs in the 1986 second quarter
and 121.6 mln dlrs in the prior first half.
    It said the increase in loss reserves was due to its
appraisal of the worldwide economy, particularly in less
developed countries that are experiencing payment problems.
    The company said the part of its loss reserve allocated to
such countries is about 35 pct of its loans to those countries.
It said the move would not result in any change to its current
dividend policy.

<TITLE>A.H. ROBINS &lt;QRAH> WINS APPEALS COURT RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A.H. Robins Co, facing suits over its
Dalkon Shield birth control device, said a Federal Court of
Appeals approved of the way the company notified potential
victims about a possible liability.
    The notification of potential claimants, which began in
january 1986 and ended several months later, was challenged by
some claimant committees who said the company's program was
inadequate.
    A company spokesman said A.H. Robins was pleased with the
ruling, noting an unfavorable decision would have "set the
whole thing back for quite some time."
    The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the fourth
circuit, which upheld a lower court, said, "the notification
program used by Robins was ... reasonable.
    "The evidence indicates that every news outlet in the world
received the information. Simiarly, there is strong evidence
that the news was broadly disseminated worldwide.
    "Women from such unlikely locations as Kenya, Botswana,
Pakistan and Bangladesh ultimately filed claims. A battery of
world health and welfare organizations also disseminated the
information. It appears to this Court that the extensive
notification program was a success."

<DATELINE>    LIMA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru's state minerals marketing arm, Minero
Peru Comercial SA (Minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zinc
ingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery at
Cajamarquilla, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid
and roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 had
been resolved.
    However, he said production of zinc ingots this year was
expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at
Cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the
stoppage.
    The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of
100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of
refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.

    The agency cited Southland's announcement that it is
studying various restructuring alternatives. S and P said that
the company has been a rumored takeover target for a while, and
a restructuring would probably be a defensive move to thwart an
unfriendly bid.

<TITLE>UK "STAR WARS" CONTRACTS SEEN AS TOO SMALL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>British companies are being largely
frozen out of President Reagan's "Star Wars" project despite
earlier hopes of lucrative contracts from the research bonanza,
according to a report by Members of Parliament (MPs).
    Funding for the project, formally known as the Strategic
Defence Initiative (SDI), has so far amounted to some 7.5
billion dlrs, parliament's Defence Committee said.
    But British contractors have won only 34 mln dlrs of this
-- 20 mln dlrs on a government-to-government basis, with the
rest secured directly by U.K. Firms and institutions.
    In December 1985, Britain and the United States signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) relating to cooperative
research for the Strategic Defence Initiative.
    At the time, hopes were expressed that U.K. Industrial
participation would lead to significant spin-off of technology,
both of other defence areas and to the civil sector.
    But the all-party committee report said "the debate about
the merits of U.K. Participation in SDI has now to be conducted
within a rather different context than was the case when the
MoU was negotiated.... It has become evident that SDI
participation may not be the great bonanza that some thought."
    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been one of
President Reagan's few staunch supporters on his plan to
development an anti-ballistic missile defence screen.
    But government sources said she has become angry about
bureaucratic barriers to British companies trying to break into
the lucrative American defence market generally -- a view
voiced again today by her defence minister, George Younger.
    He told a gathering here of British and American
businessmen, "We in Europe greatly welcome the emphasis which
you in the U.S. Have placed on cooperation and collaboration in
the defence equipment sphere."
    He added, "But I do worry that the failure of important and
influential individuals in Congress and elsewhere to realise
the true nature of the two-way street in terms of ideas,
technology and equipment will lead to the erection of
artificial barriers."
    "I am afraid that the danger signals are only too visible in
the form of both of the legislative proposals which seem to
arise with ever increasing frequency on (Capitol) Hill, and of
new regulations from the U.S. Administration," Younger said.
    "The defence balance of trade with the U.K. and other allies
is still markedly in favour of the U.S."
    Thatcher will visit Washington next month for talks with
President Reagan. U.K. Government officials said she would
probably raise the subject of defence trade when they meet.
    The report by Parliament's Defence Committee said that the
British position towards SDI was based on four points agreed
between Thatcher and Reagan in December 1984, they being that:
    - The aim was not superiority, but to maintain balance
    - SDI-related deploymewnt would be a matter for negotiation
    - The overall aim is to enhance, not undercut, deterence
    - East-West negotiation should aim to achieve security with
reduced levels of offensive systems on both sides.
    The committee in its report said, "we very much support the
government's view that SDI research should proceed only within
the framework of the Camp David "four points" and in particular
that it should be in entire conformity with the provisions of
the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty."
    "We note that all present and envisaged SDI work undertaken
by UK contractors falls in the "narrow" interpretation of the
treaty, (and) we recommend that the government takes the
appropriate steps to ensure that this continues to be the case."
    That definition prohibits the U.S. And Soviet Union from
developing, testing or deploying ABM systems, experts said.
    That recommendation would of course change, it added, if "it
has become clear that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in
renouncing the constraints of the narrow interpretation."
    Regarding possibilities for technology spin-offs, the
committee report said that "the present predominance of "paper
studies" in SDI contracts awarded to British firms and
institutions militates against any such achievement."

    The company has yet to set a date for the meeting, but has
said it will be held before the end of August.
    Under the proposal, Carter Hawley would split into a
specialty store company and a department store company.
    Shareholders would get 17-dlrs in cash and a share in each
of the two new companies for each existing common share they
hold. The restructuring was announced in December, after Carter
Hawley rejected a buy-out offer by Retail Partners.

<TITLE>SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
approve of the proposal.
    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
examining farm programs.
    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
"Family Farm Act."
    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
and reduce government spending on agriculture.
    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
increase overall revenue from exports.
    This would be done by seeking agreement among major
exporting countries including the European Community on market
sharing at agreed high prices.
    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
stem more from "gouging" by food processing companies than from
high farm product prices.
    Harkin cited what he termed "excessive" net returns on
equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
Quaker Oats.
    -- Harkin said a "legitimate" concern about his bill would
be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
grain stocks for three years.
    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
"predictable and stable" grain price, he said.
    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
participation would be no more "mandatory" than the current
farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
farm income.

<DATELINE>    Calgary, Alberta, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nova Corp is considering a
takeover bid for Dome Petroleum Ltd, either alone or as part of
a consortium, Nova chairman Bob Blair said.
    "We are thinking about making an offer to Dome or Amoco
(Canada Petroleum Co Ltd) or the creditors," Blair told
reporters before the annual meeting. Amoco Canada is a unit of
Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, which has made a 5.2 billion-dlr acquisition
offer for Dome.
    "There is ongoing, serious thought applied to Dome in Nova
and in Husky, but no decision of substance as to future action
has been taken in either company," Blair said. Nova owns 43 pct
of Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO.TO>.
    Blair also said that Nova has made no decision as to
whether it would want to be lead partner in a joint purchase of
Dome.
    He added that some of the discussions with other parties
about Dome included TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP>, but
refused to name the other participants.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kraft Inc said it strongly disagreed
with a complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission that it
made false and misleading claims about its Kraft Singles cheese
product and said it would fight the charge.
    "Kraft has always been committed to informative and
truthful advertising and this compaign clearly meets those
criteria," Kraft said in a prepared statement.
    "We believe the integreity of the advertising will be
established through the litigation process," Kraft said.
    Company spokesman Scott Horne said he could not elaborate
on the statement because the case is being litigated.
    The FTC charged Kraft with making false and misleading
claims in its advertising by overstating the calcuim content of
its Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Process Cheese Food.
    In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged the
Glenview, Ill., food and consumer products company with falsely
claiming that a slice of Kraft Singles contains the same amount
of calcium as five ounces of milk.
    The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singles
contain more calcium than most slices of imitation cheese and
that it could substantiate its claims, the FTC charged.

<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE STAFFER CONSIDERED TO HEAD CFTC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A White House associate personnel
director, Mark Sullivan, emerged as a possible candidate to
replace Susan Phillips as chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC).
    Commodity industry and government sources said Sullivan,
who is not well known to the commodities industry, has emerged
this week as a surprise candidate for the post.
    Sullivan, an attorney, has been in charge of Reagan
administration personnel appointments in the legal and
financial affairs areas since July, 1986.
    Phillips resigned last month to assume the post of vice
president of finance at the University of Iowa.
    Following Phillips' resignation CFTC commissioner Kalo
Hineman, a Kansas farmer, or commissioner Robert Davis were
considered the strongest candidates to head the agency, at
least temporarily.
    However, industry sources said the strong speculation about
Sullivan suggests he now is the leading candidate.
    Sullivan's name has also been floated recently for other
Reagan administration financial regulatory positions. He was
rumored in April to be under consideration for a position on
the board of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
Savings and Loan Associations.

<TITLE>OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German economic growth will slow to
1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic
demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its
semi-annual review of the world economy.
    This view is less favourable than the West German
government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this
year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic
institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.
    The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,
with the gross national product rising by two pct in real
terms.
    The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing
through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some
recovery in business confidence in the near future.
    But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy
was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by
2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.
    While noting that the government is bringing forward a five
billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that "the
medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy
could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow
relatively lower tax rates."
    Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal
Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP
actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of
this year compared with the final three months of 1986.
    Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared
likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
    West Germany's current account surplus, the target of
considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is
expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from
35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in
1988.

<TITLE>HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's growth rate is expected to
strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
higher than in the first half of this year.
    The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
    Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.

<TITLE>ITALIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK LESS BRIGHT, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988
is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly
lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade
deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said.
    But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a
slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last
year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing
economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.
    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,
but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.
    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five
pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in
import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour
costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report
said.
    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand
should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption
made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.
    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in
Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and
adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in
a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's trade surplus is likely to
continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
said.
    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
export markets rose by only two pct.
    But it said this differential between the growth of
domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
"thus weakening the international adjustment process."
    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
    The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current account
surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
on the yen." It said that further appreciation could then lead
manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
weaken domestic growth.
    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

<TITLE>U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
research groups.
    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
border trade would benefit both countries.
    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'
generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
sustainable without a new agreement."
    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
remaining between their two countries.
    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
remained.
    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
exports to Canada.
    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
    It would also increase the gross national products of both
countries.
    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Economic growth will remain sluggish in
the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may
rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
forecast.
    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and
next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD
said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could
stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus
will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.
    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming
its borrowing requirement, "it will probably be insufficient to
check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit," the OECD said.
    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5
pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming
less competitive and imports rising. "Employment is forecast to
decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the
private sector and budgetary cuts," the report said.
    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987
and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining
domestic gas prices.
    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster
growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in
wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.

<TITLE>SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Strong growth in domestic demand was a key
feature of the economies of southern European countries in
1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total
domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
restrained private consumption.
    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
to be halved to five pct next year.
    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross
Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption
were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
strong.
    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply
next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European
Community and declining competitiveness.
    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
following an increase early this year linked with the
introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due
to cold weather.

<TITLE>OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>High wage settlements in Nordic countries
threaten to cut exports and reduce the international
competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in
early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration
in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen
at risk from accelerating wages.
    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under
pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as
Norway, Sweden and Finland.
    Overall economic growth will vary in the different
countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report
said.
    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic
demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one
pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a
slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in
Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark
and Norway.
    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic
strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained
and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.

<TITLE>OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States should take urgent
action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible
reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on
growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
    The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,
said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress
quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "could seriously
affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere."
    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,
running until September 30 this year, would substantially
overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion
dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.
    "The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of
slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the
first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190
billion dollars," it said.
    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's
deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax
increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.
    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to
2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.
    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports
boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.
    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service
sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be
heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer
prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next
year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.
    "Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors
behind the avoidance of recession," the report said.
    The current account balance of payments deficit is expected
to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after
hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.
    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly
to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will
still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is
expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,
unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct
this year.
    Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to
around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about
that level in 1988.

<TITLE>JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects for world economic growth remain
very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.
    "The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
imbalances are likely to persist," it said in one of its
gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of
western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
2.5 pct growth rate.
    "We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area
comfortably exceeding three pct," David Henderson, head of the
OECD's economics and statistics department, said.
    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising
inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,
Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
downturn.
    "At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
remain favorable," it said, citing low inflation in most major
countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
labor markets.
    But private sector confidence had been undermined by
uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that "for
confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."
    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord
of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.
    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major
countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to
undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand
in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.
    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works
and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
impact.
    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic
demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.
    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast
to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
increase in 1986.
    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
year.
    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world
agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
price guarantees and other measures linked to production
towards direct income support for farmers.
